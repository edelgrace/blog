This morning I had band practice. I enjoyed this band practice actually. We mostly just practiced Holiday and our &#8220;BGHS MARCHING GHOSTS&#8221; and &#8220;HUAH&#8221; yelling. It was honestly amusing. Tara and Conrad were singled out and it was hilarious. Conrad&#8217;s voice was deep and manly while Tara&#8217;s voice was rather girly and high pitched but louder than Conrad. I laughed.

In spare we watched half of the live version of Peter Pan. I loved it. But the bell rang right during the &#8220;I believe in faries, I do, I do!&#8221; part. We were all chanting and everything. It was disappointing. That&#8217;s the only thing I hate about the shorter classes on Friday. Shorter spare!

Math was fun. Review time. Whoot. In physics, I don&#8217;t know what we did in physics. Just random vectors shizsticks. It&#8217;s rather boring so it slips out of my mind easily. In chemistry we did some more work on Hess&#8217; law. So far I&#8217;m loving and cherishing how school is easy.
