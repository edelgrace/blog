On Goodreads, my &#8220;want-to-own&#8221; shelf used to have 127 books in it. Now it has five.

Recently I&#8217;ve been bit by the konmari bug. I&#8217;ve konmari&#8217;d my wardrobe and my books so far. I&#8217;m still stuck on the books. I decided it would be fitting to prevent my book collection from growing back to it&#8217;s ridiculous size and get rid of anything that doesn&#8217;t spark joy on my book wish list.

### Books that made the cut

**The Last Unicorn by Peter S. Beagle**  
I read this book a couple of years ago. Although it&#8217;s aimed at a younger audience, I really enjoyed this story. After reading it, I went to watch the animated movie as well. A small part of me has always been fascinated by unicorns and horses (I blame Sailor Moon as the source of that).

**The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde**  
To be honest, I don&#8217;t remember much of this book but I do remember being in awe of Wilde&#8217;s writing. I remember the last few pages more than anything. It was not exactly terrifying but it was a bit&#8230; Grotesque? I mostly want this book so I can re-read it.

**The Master and Margarita by Mikhail Bulgakov**  
A couple of years ago I took a Russian Literature course and had to do a group presentation on this book. This book is probably one of the very few that I actually read front to back for a class. Actually, I read all the required books in this course. That was a first for me. Bulgakov&#8217;s imagination is borderline execessive with this work but I do like his alternative history spin on Jesus&#8217; life.

**The Glass Menagerie by Tenesee Williams**  
Marie Kondo&#8217;s motto is to get rid of anything that doesn&#8217;t spark joy. This play is incredibly sad but in a way, it also sparks joy for me. I find it to be such a heartbreakingly simple story that I can&#8217;t help but appreciate it.

**Sabriel by Garth Nix**  
When I was younger, I was totally absorbed in fantasy. I don&#8217;t know what happened, I hardly ever read any of the fantasy genre anymore. Sabriel really touched something in me. I got sucked into the world. One of my childhood friends recently (as in, like a couple of weeks ago) told me that I reminded her of Sabriel. She was the one who recommended this book to me way back when. That&#8217;s another thing that I appreciate about this book.

### Books that almost made the cut

**Paradise Kiss series by Ai Yazawa**  
Okay, I&#8217;m still on the fence about this one. I love this series and I love Ai Yazawa&#8217;s work. Paradise Kiss is one of those series that sat with me for a while. Maybe I&#8217;ll have to read this one over again and see how I feel about it. The reason why I&#8217;m not sure is because I feel like there&#8217;s something unsettling about it. It&#8217;s a little similar to how I feel about _The Glass Menagerie_. It&#8217;s incredibly bittersweet. There are some scenes that I remember that actually make me feel a pang in my chest. I&#8217;m tearing up right now thinking about it!

**A Great and Terrible Beauty by Libba Bray**  
The Gemma Doyle series is pretty okay but damn, the covers are gorgeous (yes, I&#8217;m a little shallow). I love the gothic setting and historical aspect of it but unfortunately, it was lacking in content a little. It would be nice to have it sit on my shelf and look pretty but I would never pick it up and read it again.
