Okay, so I&#8217;m going to rant about Michael Jackson. Here&#8217;s a journal entry I made a couple days ago at my DeviantArt account.

&#8220;I have been mourning for days now. No joke. Downloading MJ songs, watching tributes, joining Facebook fan pages, watching lives, reading articles, and whatever.

He&#8217;s such a beautiful man even with the white make up and the plastic surgery. You see him smile, and you think &#8220;Awww.&#8221; Haha. Old man. XD

The Lisa-Marie blog post made me bawl so hard. I never knew the amount of emotional pain he was in. Of course, it&#8217;s expected, right? He&#8217;s fragile. No. He&#8217;s human. For the first time in a while, I saw him as that. Human. A person. Not the &#8220;rapist&#8221; (which he isn&#8217;t), or the &#8220;plastic man&#8221;, or the &#8220;white but black guy&#8221;. I saw him as a human, a father, a husband, and a son. He was just really talented.

I regret not seeing him live. Now I never will! AHH!!

Anyway.

I love the song Ben. That last verse just reflects Michael so well.

&#8220;Ben, the two of us need look no more
  
We both found what we were looking for
  
With a friend to call my own
  
I&#8217;ll never be alone
  
And you my friend will see
  
You&#8217;ve got a friend in me

Ben, you&#8217;re always running here and there
  
You feel you&#8217;re not wanted anywhere
  
If you ever look behind
  
And don&#8217;t like what you find
  
There&#8217;s something you should know
  
You&#8217;ve got a place to go

I used to say
  
I and me
  
Now it&#8217;s us
  
Now it&#8217;s we

(I used to say
  
I and me
  
Now it&#8217;s us
  
Now it&#8217;s we)

Ben, most people would turn you away
  
I don&#8217;t listen to a word they say
  
They don&#8217;t see you as I do
  
I wish they would try to
  
I&#8217;m sure they&#8217;d think again
  
If they had a friend like Ben&#8221;

I can&#8217;t listen to this song without crying TT_TT

RIP Michael Jackson. Our king of pop!&#8221;

So as you can see, I am HEARTBROKEN over Michael Jackson. What I keep asking myself is &#8220;Was it preventable?&#8221; Could anyone inetervened to stop whatever lead to his death? Why didn&#8217;t anyone try harder to stop his drug use? What&#8217;s going to happen to his kids? What about his tour? Oh sheesh, I&#8217;m getting stressed over this.

I&#8217;m going crazy! I love Michael to death.

So I&#8217;m going to make a HUGE tribute to Michael Jackson. Graphics wise.
