Writing stuff down in a list because I&#8217;m so tired but I don&#8217;t want to forget.

  * Pizza 73 is no longer a thing. They took it out of our food court on campus to replace it with Tim&#8217;s. The lack of pizza on campus makes me sad!
  * The Korean place omg. We waited for like three waves of full length lines until the order was ready. Ok.
  * I&#8217;ve never gotten shushed before, oops.
  * Campaigning, wooh! <sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_1-651" id="back_ajs-fn-id_1-651">1</a></sup>
  * We met one of the engineering representative candidates and he was absolutely delightful, wow.
  * Comrade did not win after all. And the presidential candidate I was rooting for didn&#8217;t either. Disappointment. But it was a great experience!
  * I&#8217;m so tired. It&#8217;s almost midnight. Ah.
