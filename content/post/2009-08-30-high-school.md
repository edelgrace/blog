Hello! Okay so I started high school. I don&#8217;t have much time to say much, but I&#8217;ll try my best. Ignore spelling mistakes please.

I just found out that the guy I&#8217;ve been liking for the past couple of years is a complete jerk and that a character from one of my stories has a look alike in the real world. The look alike thing is the thing that concerns me more.

They look exactly alike. EXACTLY! It&#8217;s creepy. Some people say it&#8217;s fate but I just think it&#8217;s creepy. The way they walk, they way they talk&#8230;it&#8217;s all the same. I first came up with the character after a blonde version of my cousin. Read the story [here][1]{.external}.

When I first saw &#8220;That Guy&#8221; on the first day of school (Thursday) I was finished taking (horrbile) pictures. My TA teacher walked us to the classroom and there outside the gym was That Guy. He smiled, nodded at Mr O&#8217;Gorman and said &#8220;Hey, Mr O&#8217;Gorman. I&#8217;m not going to be taking your social class&#8230;.&#8221;

I kinda tuned out cause I was so shocked. It was so weird. Then I saw him again on Friday. Ah. He had the most killer stare ever. And the way he walked, his head up on an angle&#8230;ah. So cute. Just like my character&#8230;

Anyway, gotta go print out my schedule. Bye~
