The **kya! effect** is in progress&#8230; kind of.

Ever since the new year started, I&#8217;ve been thinking of changing the site name to &#8220;kya!&#8221; as &#8220;Ueda ♥ Love&#8221; can imply that it is just a fansite dedicated to Ueda Tatsuya.

I&#8217;ve gotten a new layout (hint: ***J-Rock FTW?***) all ready. I&#8217;m working on the pages. With the &#8220;kya! effect&#8221; I&#8217;m going to focus on my fandoms. Like fanlists, tribute pages, etc etc. Originally, that&#8217;s what Ueda Love was supposed to be.

I&#8217;ll still blog! But I don&#8217;t think a lot of people enjoy my ranting haha.

And of this moment I submitted an application form for a fanlist for the song &#8220;외톨이 (Loner/Alone)&#8221; by Outsider.

I LOVE OUTSIDER. He&#8217;s the best Korean rapper ever. Way better than G-Dragon. He actually speaks about things in his songs. He&#8217;s pretty cute as well :3 Haha. I&#8217;ve gotten Dylan to listen to Outsider and he as well now loves him. Ahh yay for Asian music&#8230;

Anyway. Valentines Day is tomorrow. Ah. What do I do? How can I show Dylan my affection online? Gah XD Valentines day just complicates things even more. Pressures couples to buy things/do special things together. Why this day? Why buy things/spend time on this ONE day? Shouldn&#8217;t you just do those things because you care for them, not because the holiday says no? Kinda sound slike a money making scheme. But yes, I guess Valentines day can be special. Feel free to argue with me. Haha.

Ah, fandom.

I&#8217;m watching this really scary anime Dylan told me to watch. It&#8217;s scary but I LOVE IT. I jumped like three times within the first 45 seconds of it. How sad am I? There&#8217;s this robot girl named Pino. She dresses up in a bunny suit and is soooo cute. Haha. Only an otaku would probably think that ^^&#8221;

Oh what have I been doing today? Procrastinating on homework. Watching anime. Reading manga. Coding. Website browsing. Only a girl who&#8217;s really bored looks at the DMW member list from top to bottom. It was fun though!

I haven&#8217;t run out of things to say but I&#8217;ll stop for now. My rants are too long&#8230; Anyway, mata ne~! [See you later~!]
