&#8230; Is getting an adult library card. I&#8217;m not even joking. I detested the teen library card. It was too &#8220;hip&#8221; for me. So I rather like my simplistic and pretty white adult library card. The bad thing is that I have to memorize a new card number. Although the number for my new card has bits and pieces of my address and home phone number so I reckon it&#8217;s not that bad.

And so I made my first library haul of the year with my shiny new library card! It took me an hour because I was pressed for time and with the fact that I probably won&#8217;t have too much time for reading. I finished one of them in a jiffy though.<span id="more-210"></span>

These pictures are pretty shoddy, mostly due to the fact that I took them with my only camera at the moment, my iPod. In case you can&#8217;t read the titles in the pictures, here are the books I took out:

  * At a Crossroads by Kate T. Williamson
  * The Twelve Kingdoms: Sea of Wind by Fuyumi Ono
  * The Case for God by Karen Armstong
  * Twelve Steps to a Compassionate Life by Karen Armstrong
  * A Short History of Myth by Karen Armstrong

As you can tell, I&#8217;m a big fan of Karen Armstrong. I&#8217;ve read her memoir, &#8220;Through the Narrow Gate,&#8221; and watched her prize winning TED talk, &#8220;The Charter for Compassion&#8221; and loved both of them. Armstrong is clearly an eloquent, intelligent, and passionate woman, and I cannot begin to explain how much I admire her for it. I can&#8217;t wait to dig into my first reads of 2013!

I &#8216;m starting my reading with &#8220;The Case for God&#8221; by Karen Armstrong first (for now), mostly because I don&#8217;t want to find myself two days before the due date and finding myself just starting it. Although on second thought I just might read the shorter ones first, but I&#8217;ll see what happens. Once I get into reading any of Armstrong&#8217;s work, I can&#8217;t seem to put them down.
