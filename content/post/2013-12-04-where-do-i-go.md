I don&#8217;t miss people much. Usually when I&#8217;m away from people, I feel relieved. Relaxed. At peace. Almost happy.

However, when things go bad, there&#8217;s one person I long for.

Then I realize I can&#8217;t text him. I can&#8217;t pull up Facebook and chat with him.

What I&#8217;m feeling is selfish. So selfish.

I wish he was here so he could help me and I could talk to him about everything. My doubts. My fears. My lack of a love and social life.

Was I one of the ones who drove him away? Did my burdens become too much for him to handle? I wish he needed me as much as I needed him. Maybe he&#8217;d still be here.

Sometimes I forget he&#8217;s gone. When I realize he&#8217;s gone, sometimes I forget that he&#8217;s gone forever. But maybe we will meet someday. I hope so. Until then, where do I go?
