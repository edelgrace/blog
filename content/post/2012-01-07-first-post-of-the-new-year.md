Most people&#8217;s first post of the year is on the first, but no, I&#8217;m unique and I&#8217;ll have mine six days later. I&#8217;ve been busy studying and working on [Room 304][1]. I&#8217;m actually being productive. Okay, yesterday and the day before I didn&#8217;t study at all and now I&#8217;m freaking out because I have a test on Monday. What do I do about it? I post on my blog. Oh the life of a procrastinator.

Yesterday I had quite a fun day. Firstly, went to Wal-Mart and bought _Assassin&#8217;s Creed_ for our shiny new PS3 that we got over Christmas. Actually, I made the choice to buy it and not my brother. I&#8217;ve been wanting to play that game ever since I had the demo on my iPod. Needless to say, when I got home I was glued to the TV screen and the controller for the rest of the day.

After that, we went to the library. I love the library. I could spend all day in there if the family weren&#8217;t rushing every single time we go. I got four books and a CD.

I nearly flipped out when I looked at the CD. _DIR EN GREY &#8211; DUM SPIRO SPERO_. Okay, if you don&#8217;t know, I&#8217;m a **huge** DIR EN GREY fan. They&#8217;re a Japanese band so buying their music is really expensive (shipping costs, the horror) so I rarely buy anything of theirs. I&#8217;ve been waiting to listen to this album for the longest time and I refused to download it anywhere. Now I can listen to it without feeling that guilty, because it&#8217;s from the library. I&#8217;m still going to buy it eventually though.

The thing about the library is that it&#8217;s right next to the mall. Where did we go next? The mall. I don&#8217;t like shopping for clothes but I need clothes so I had to buy clothes. That part was boring.

Like I said before, we got home and I spent the rest of the day playing _Assassin&#8217;s Creed_. It&#8217;s such a good game&#8230; I want the other Assassin&#8217;s Creed games. Expect they&#8217;re so expensive! Another time I guess.
