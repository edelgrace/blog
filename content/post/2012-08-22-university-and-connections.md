These summer months has been filled with e-mails from my university and just me chatting on the Internet. As September is coming closer everyday, I&#8217;m getting pretty excited, nervous, and really bummed out. This morning, I received an e-mail listing all of the things I should get done before school starts. Most of them are finished, but there are three major things that I can&#8217;t actually do just yet.

**My picture ID**
  
I have to submit a picture of myself online for ID card, ONEcard is what my university calls. The only problem is that our only camera (that&#8217;s not the camera on my iPod) was stolen when my dad went to the Philippines. I&#8217;m really regretting that. My graduation pictures were on that camera and I forgot to transfer those pictures onto my computer. Good thing I managed to print some of them off but they&#8217;re really low quality.

**UPASS**
  
One of the perks of my university is that we pay a small fee for a semster&#8217;s worth of transit use. Seeing as I don&#8217;t drive yet, I need this because I&#8217;ll be taking the train. They say you can get your UPASS stickers now but you need a ONEcard to put the UPASS sticker on. And I don&#8217;t have one because I don&#8217;t have a camera. Ah, what a dilemma!

**Textbooks**
  
Textbook lists are finally out and I viewed all my textbooks for this semester, and the total comes around to $450. At first I was like, &#8220;That&#8217;s not that bad!&#8221; but then I realized that&#8217;s only one semester. I want to buy books as soon as possible but I&#8217;m not sure if I should go secondhand or if I should even buy all of them. I have to wait a couple of hours anyway because I don&#8217;t have a credit card.

In addition to this, I went shopping for school supplies a couple of days ago. It doesn&#8217;t look like a lot on paper, but it actually is a lot, as I&#8217;m sure most of you will know. So here&#8217;s what I got:

  * A crap load of pens, pencils, erasers, and highlighters
  * Sticky notes and sticky page flag thingies
  * A binder
  * An expandable file folder (a suggestion from [Kim][1]{.external} in this [article][2])
  * A planner agenda thingy
  * A couple of notebooks

So while all of that is happening, I&#8217;m talking to my Internet friends. One of my friends is a math genius. He&#8217;s going to Oxford for goodness sakes. He was showing me some of the tests he took and I realized that I really don&#8217;t remember anything I learned last semester. Differentiate? Gradient? Tangent lines? I&#8217;m thinking that I need to brush up on my calculus and all around math skills before I go back to university. Like&#8230; It looks quite manageable but my mind is drawing a blank right now. I should probably go hit the books&#8230;
