I meant to post this Friday but that never really happened. Anyway, better late than never!

So far, school is doing pretty good. I know people in each of my classes and the homework isn&#8217;t too hard yet. However, there&#8217;s one class that I absolutely dread going to. That class is physics. I don&#8217;t dread it because the content is hard. I dead it because of the people in it.

Since I didn&#8217;t have room in my schedule last year, I had to take physics 20. Most of the class are grade elevens. I know a bunch of cool grade elevens. Sadly, 99% of them did not end up in my class. There&#8217;s one or two of my friends in it. Most of the rest of the class is, well, really bad.

They&#8217;re always talking. Not that I don&#8217;t mind them talking but there are 40 kids in a tiny cramped room all talking loudly at the same time. It&#8217;s hard to hear and I get quite frustrated when I&#8217;m surrounded by noise. I&#8217;m not the only one too. The teacher gets frustrated as well. To say the least, my physics teacher isn&#8217;t the most youngest person ever. It gets hard for him to start class because no one can hear him say that.
