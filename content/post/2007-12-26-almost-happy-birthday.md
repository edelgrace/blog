My birthday is in four days! I&#8217;ll finally be thirteen! I have had it with people staring at me and going, &#8220;You&#8217;re still twelve?&#8221; It&#8217;s annoying. I&#8217;m not the only twelve year old in grade eight! 

One of my friends is already fourteen! She can get her learner&#8217;s permit nd she cant get over the fact she&#8217;s two years older than me. At least I&#8217;m not like my one friend. HHe doesnt turn thirteen until February.

Another great thing: in three days my cousin is coming to Canada! I&#8217;m excited because she&#8217;s from way back in the Philippines and I haven&#8217;t seen her since fourth grade. But it&#8217;s kinda complicated with her. My mom booked the flight without asking her mom but I was the one who asked if she could come before or on my brithday. I want her to play laser quest with me and my friends on sunday.

I got an iPod nano today! I was really surprised because I didnt even ask for an iPod nano, and its not christmas anymore. Whatever. 

I&#8217;m listening to an awesome song. Sweet Child O&#8217; Mine by Guns N&#8217; Roses

I love December.
