I&#8217;m glad the burial is coming up. All I can say is &#8220;FINALLY!&#8221; I love Michael Jackson. I&#8217;m still so sad. I love Michael! Did I already say that? Oh. Anyway. Everyone is saying that he&#8217;s gay, but I refuse to believe it because he is mine and I love him! Just kidding. Michael Jackson fans are crazy&#8230; R.I.P Michael!

Today I went to the Balzack mall that just opened. It&#8217;s big but not that big. Not as big as West Ed.

I&#8217;m not sure what else to talk about&#8230;

School&#8217;s coming up in 5 days! Yay! I am looking forward to being egged by sophmores! Not. Oh well, since I am tiny, I will be a harder target. Sarah says she&#8217;s going to help me&#8230;protect me? Oh, and school photos are on the first day. Lovely.

I&#8217;m reunited with my long lost e-mail pal! Jen! We meet on AFO (no longer running) by a fluke. I was asking her for help on the forum. I was digging through old e-mails and I saw our conversations. Then I e-mailed her a couple days ago. She sounds like she&#8217;s doing well. Yay, I&#8217;m glad things are going great for her. I love Jen!

Anyway, I have to get designing&#8230; Ja, mata!
