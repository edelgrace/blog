I&#8217;m thinking about going on hiatus. Just thinking. I have a whole new site purpose for this website now.

I think I&#8217;m going to convert it into an icon dump. I love making icons and make about five a day. XD It would be nice&#8230; I think I will! But not the hiatus part.

Repeat: I will **not** go on hiatus.

But I will revamp without a hiatus. Start almost new. New affies, new rules, etc. I have a bunch of plans for this summer! :DD
