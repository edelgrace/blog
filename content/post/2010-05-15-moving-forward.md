I have exciting news I kinda forgot to tell all of you about!

**I now have a domain name.**

[Pure Orenji][1]

Please check it out! And no, I won&#8217;t be leaving Ueda Love. I would never do that! Pure Orenji is just a gateway of sorts to all of the sites I own. It&#8217;s currently under construction.

Oh, I have also a fanlisting collective I&#8217;ve set up. Be sure to check this out as well.

I&#8217;ve been trying to keep myself busy since various recent events and I have a huge to do list that I want to accomplish before I go off to tour in the summer! Which is in about two-three weeks&#8230; Never wrecking! Uwah~! Anyway, just keeping you updated! See you!
