Why are there so many songs about Friday? It&#8217;s a great day but I don&#8217;t want to hear people sing &#8220;Friday&#8221; and &#8220;Last Friday Night&#8221; off key all day.

Anyway, Fridays are usually those days that you just want to fast forward through.

In band, we got a talk from Mr. Reigel. The whole, &#8220;you&#8217;re private life does affect the team&#8221; talk. He talked a bit about drugs and alchohol and such. I couldn&#8217;t help but think, &#8220;Brad, Brad, Brad, Brad, Brad&#8221; in my head while he was talking about it. Yeah. I guess I&#8217;m not exactly part of the team as I&#8217;m not in marching band but I guess you can say I&#8217;m&#8230; A guest team member? I don&#8217;t even know.

Math was boring as always. But it was good bonding time with Mike and Dylan. I enjoy those two. &#8216;Tis never a dull moment.

Physics. Can I please just yell at the whole class to shut up and behave without feeling bad and embarrased?

Chemistry was more stoichiometry review. I was in weekend mode the whole period.

Weekends for me a rather boring though. It mostly consists of studying, homework, fooling around on the Internet, or doing something with my family (and in that order too). This weekend I have to study quite a bit. I have three unit tests next week. And all one after the other. It&#8217;s kinda stressful, but I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll do well&#8230; Hopefully, anyway.
