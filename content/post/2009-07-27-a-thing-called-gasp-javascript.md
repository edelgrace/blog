Yeah, I&#8217;m trying to find ways to properly display my avatars and future graphics! I&#8217;m trying to setup Lightbox, but the thing is that the &#8220;white space&#8221; is too little. I put captions underneath and it&#8217;s all&#8230;um. Weird!

Any ideas? I tried to increase the padding, but it did some weird stuff (the avatar wasn&#8217;t in the white space&#8230;). Does it make sense? I hope it does&#8230;

I&#8217;m working on all those projects below (see last entry) and my fanfic. Yay! I feel so happy when I write. Why did I stop again? Oh, right. School. Gah.

Anyway, my parents are forcing me to go to bed and it&#8217;s barely 10 pm. Why can&#8217;t I stay up later?

Well, I&#8217;m going fishing&#8230;I can&#8217;t remember when, but I am so catch you later! (Haha, you get it? No? Oh&#8230;)
