Yes! Haha. Michal Jackson time! I&#8217;m still pretty broken up about his death, but I just love looking at pictures of him! And videos&#8230; Yesterday, I even bought a Michael Jackson concert CD (haha&#8230;).

So, I just watched Up! It was really good. Except for my left ear that was blocked, and I forgot to bring glasses/put in my contacts. Ugh, my stupidness! It happens often&#8230;My memory is bad, even though I&#8217;m still young. >_<

Ueda &hearts Love // is dancing to Michael Jackson;; Smile

_&#8220;That&#8217;s the time you must keep on trying
  
Smile, what&#8217;s the use of crying
  
You&#8217;ll find that life is still worthwhile
  
If you&#8217;ll just Smile&#8230;&#8221;_

R.I.P Michael Jackson <3
