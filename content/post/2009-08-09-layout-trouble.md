Thanks to Olivia for pointing out my layout issue! I didn&#8217;t notice&#8230;it looked fine when I first uploaded it. So I switched to the old one while I work out the kinks. Gah!

Anyway~ I just had a party. Marshmallow roasting, kids running around, drunk dads everywhere, you know the works!

AND I saw **him** today. The guy I have been liking on and off for three years now. Haha. I haven&#8217;t seen him since Father&#8217;s Day and I didn&#8217;t say anything to him back then&#8230; Let&#8217;s call him&#8230; Gunther. He is so cute. My knees turn to jelly when I see him, and I can hardly talk. And surprise, when I do actually talk to him the conversations are not that bad. Gunther&#8217;s such a flirt. It&#8217;s SO weird, because I can&#8217;t tell if he likes me or not.

Oh well, since I&#8217;m going to high school in a couple of weeks I&#8217;ll get to see him more often. I hope.

Good night! My mom is ticking me off with her &#8220;Go to sleep!&#8221; screams. It&#8217;s only 9 PM. Sheesh. Wow. Bye!
