Now I have to actually study or I will be royally screwed. I&#8217;ve been studying for the past three days but not as much as I wanted to. So now I&#8217;m super stressed and all I want to do is roll up into a ball and cry. Just&#8230; The exam being worth of 50% of my mark is freaking me out too much. But being nervous doesn&#8217;t help when I study. I just get more stressed when I realize that I barely remember things.Then I don&#8217;t study efficiently and then I can&#8217;t remember anything. It&#8217;s a cycle of neverending stress. I think the stress is really getting to me too. My time of month hasn&#8217;t come yet. It&#8217;s been almost two months. Bleh. Exam break. The most hated and loved time of the year. 

So this will be the last post of January because my exams are on the 25th and the 26th. I&#8217;m officially unplugging myself from everything, and isolating myself from everyone starting tomorrow. Comments will probably not be replied to until February, sorry about that.
