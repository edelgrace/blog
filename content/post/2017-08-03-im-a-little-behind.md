A couple of days ago I was behind on my granny squares for my temperature blanket. If you don&#8217;t know, temperature blankets consist of one square a day and each square represents the temperature of that day. Thankfully, it&#8217;s easy to catch up with temperature blankets! Even though I&#8217;m caught up with the squares, I still haven&#8217;t woven the ends in yet nor have I joined them. Eek!

Last week I was babysitting my little cousin and he was playing with my yarn. He made a &#8220;bunny&#8221; and asked me to give it eyes and a nose. I tried my best with what I was given. I wasn&#8217;t satisfied but my cousin was so impressed. I love how innocent he is.

Lately I&#8217;ve been thinking how fast he&#8217;s growing up. He just recently turned 11 and he&#8217;s already almost as tall as me! Now that he&#8217;s older he&#8217;s less receptive to my affections which is a little disheartening to me since he is still so cute and sweet!

If I never have kids, I&#8217;d think I&#8217;d be content with it because I am surrounded by kids in my extended family and I&#8217;ve already watched many of them grow up. We celebrated my cousin&#8217;s birthday over the weekend. She just turned 19 and I still marvel over how it seemed like she was a small little girl just yesterday. The same goes for her brother. He&#8217;s going into grade twelve this year and I just can&#8217;t believe it. We went to a night market at our mall recently and my brother, cousin, and I just walked around by ourselves talking. It&#8217;s amazing to me how he has grown into his own person. Of course, while we were there, we got to chow down on some delicious food. I got a burger at Bandit Burger and it was absolutely delicious.

The next day we went to the park to celebrate my cousin&#8217;s birthday and we spent almost eight hours there. There was a lot of eating and we took a walk and just chatted together. We even took a nap under the tree from the food overload. It was pretty relaxing and I even sat by the water&#8217;s edge to knit for a little bit.

One of my older cousins saw me knitting and asked if I could make her daughter a hat. I said yes! I&#8217;m a little nervous because I&#8217;ve never had anyone ask me to make anything before but I would love to make my second cousin a hat. My cousin&#8217;s daughter requested that it be pink. I have no pink yarn! I guess I&#8217;ll be shopping around for pink yarn soon.
