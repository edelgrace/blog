I&#8217;ve been really unmotivated lately. I _should_ be busy with school, but I really am not. Little things keep on discouraging me and causes me to lose sight of the end goal. I don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s wrong with me. I keep telling myself, &#8220;This is your future at stake! Do you really want to be working 2 or 3 part time jobs?&#8221; But even so, it does nothing. I&#8217;m at the point where I seriously think, even for a second, to hell with society. I&#8217;ll live in my parent&#8217;s basement for the rest of my life doing whatever the heck I want to do. Society frowns upon those people but gosh darn it, they&#8217;re happy. They&#8217;re living life the way they want to.

I really just want the semester to be over. Take the Christmas break to reevaluate my life. Weed out all of the things I don&#8217;t need. Begin a new clean slate. Take charge of my websites again. Learn some time management. Will it really happen? I sure hope so.

On a lighter note. I bought Assassin&#8217;s Creed 3 last weekend. It. Was. Beautiful. Extremely frustrating, but beautiful. The graphics were clean and crisp. The landscapes huge and wide and just overall stunning. Assassin&#8217;s Creed has always been about details. Oh the details. The turkeys. The spray of snow at your heels. And limbs of a tree bouncing as you land on it. Ahhhh. Wonderful. As always, the story is really engaging and oh god, the twists and the turns. AND THE FEELS. All of my feels. It&#8217;s a bit saddening to see this arc end. I&#8217;m looking forward to the next one, nevertheless.

Even though AC3 was really good, it was largely unpolished. Surprisingly buggy too. I know no one can catch all the bugs but I&#8217;m surprised so many slipped through the cracks. It&#8217;s not the fact that they&#8217;re there but how many there are. The soundtrack is a bit disappointing too. Good. But not as good as the ones in previous titles. It definitely has to do with the fact that Jesper Kyd was not doing this soundtrack. Not to discredit Lorne Balfe of course. He composed great pieces but they lacks personality and atmosphere. The story was awesome (like I already said), but some parts of the game I was confused as to why I was doing certain things or how things were happening. Oh well. Still an awesome game overall. I&#8217;ll probably go into more detail in a later post as I&#8217;ve been itching to rant and ramble more about the game.
