This morning there was no band practice! Yay. :] So I slept in. But I came to school and the grade tens were practicing. It was loud. I don&#8217;t like loudness in the morning. I don&#8217;t think I did anything in spare though. Just sat around.

They changed the band schedules yesterday. So apparently Brad went to band this morning when there was no band. I laughed.

Augh, university stuff. Over the next couple of months there&#8217;s going to be meetings about grad and with representatives of some of the local universities or colleges. I&#8217;ve pretty much made up my mind on where I want to go as with my parents so I don&#8217;t have to worry too much about those. I&#8217;m just going to stay here in Calgary because it&#8217;s cheaper. Yeah, that&#8217;s the only reasonÂ but it&#8217;s a very good reason.

I&#8217;m thinking of engineering and that&#8217;s going to take up most of my life. No time for a job. No job means not being able to pay for dorms and such. Transit is negligible. My parents are for sure going to let me stay at home with no rental fee. Yeah, it&#8217;s all revolving around money.

But Canada isn&#8217;t **as bad** as the States, or so I&#8217;ve heard. Of course I&#8217;m still going to be paying a couple of thousand dollars plus buying books and stuff. I haven&#8217;t worked out the numbers yet but I&#8217;m going to do it before the first uni meeting on Thursday.

This is going to be the most exciting and stressful year of high school ever.
