<a rel="_nofollow" href="http://www.coffeeaddictedwriter.com/p/blog-page.html"><br /> </a><a rel="_nofollow" href="http://www.coffeeaddictedwriter.com/p/blog-page.html">Book Blogger Hop</a> is a weekly meme run by Coffee Addicted Writer. Every Friday, a question is posted for the book blog community to discuss. This week&#8217;s question is&#8230;

> How far in advance do you read the books you have scheduled for review?

I don&#8217;t read books &#8220;ahead of time.&#8221; I just read books with no schedule in mind and review them as I go. I guess this question is geared towards the more veteran book bloggers who recieve copies of books to read. I haven&#8217;t received a book to review in years and it was back when I used to win Goodreads giveaways left and right. I don&#8217;t even consider myself to be a book blogger (rather, I consider myself to be a blogger who sometimes posts about books).

I would love for someone in the blogosphere to enlighten me. ðŸ™‚
