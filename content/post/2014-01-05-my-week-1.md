I just moved into my shiny new Filofax: a personal sized Woodlands named Ainsley. I spent the day before Christmas Eve and Christmas Eve printing out my custom inserts. I&#8217;m not 100% happy with them. Good thing I didn&#8217;t print out the whole year and only printed this a semester worth of them. So this is my first week using them! Not a lot happened (besides from parties and the like) so there&#8217;s not a lot written in there.

I&#8217;m not into decorating (my reasons are similar to my first two [reasons why I don&#8217;t use makeup][1]) so future &#8220;my week&#8221; posts will be quite bland.

So here we go! :D

And a preview of this week&#8230; School is starting. :( Tomorrow I&#8217;m going to the university to do all my errands. My wallet is going to cry.
