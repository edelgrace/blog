**Listening to:** You Rock My World &#8211; Michael Jackson
  
**Mood**: Accomplished, bored.

Ahh, I&#8217;ve been doing too much gaming lately. Even though I&#8217;m only about 20 hours in on Dissidia: Final Fantasy, I love it! Like Cloud always says, I **never** want the game to end! It takes a long time to finish the game anyway. There&#8217;s so many things to do! Level-ing up, finding treasure, getting the best weapons, hidden bosses, unlockables&#8230; All of it just satisfies me! Sure, graphics are always good but I also love games with amazing plot and storylines! And characters you can relate to! Characters who you have no problem spending 55+ hours with. I may be FF obsessed. But there are others worse than me.

So this weekend has been very uneventful! I was supposed to go bowling yesterday but my parents didn&#8217;t allow me to. Ah, oh well. Not to mention it&#8217;s been a four day long weekend! Sheesh. I&#8217;ve done nothing. Except for my _LONER_ fanlisting. =]
