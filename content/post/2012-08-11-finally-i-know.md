I&#8217;ve finally been officially accepted into the engineering program at my local university!! I&#8217;m super crazy excited for university. I can&#8217;t wait to start a new clean slate. New school supplies (I admit, I enjoy this part the most), new subjects, new campus, new professors, new schedule, new everything. Speaking of schedules, I&#8217;ve had my schedule done since May but I was hesitant to post it, seeing as I wasn&#8217;t 100% sure I was going to be accepted. I didn&#8217;t personally do my schedule though. Prospective engineers are a special bunch, apparently it&#8217;s too confusing if we make our schedules, so the department puts us into &#8220;blocks&#8221; with predetermined schedules. That means, I have the same schedule as a couple of other students as well. I kind of feel sorry for those students, because I feel like the schedule I have is horribly balanced. I&#8217;m not too sure if that&#8217;s the norm, though. It probably is. My Thursdays are killer in my first semester. And in my second semester, I don&#8217;t have any lectures or labs every second Monday. I should be happy about this development but I feel like I&#8217;m going to be screwed by it later on&#8230;

      In another news, I&#8217;m currently watching DIR EN GREY&#8217;s 24 Hour Special Program on Niconico (or is it Nico Nico?). Currently it&#8217;s at 14 hours and 52 minutes. I definitely did not stay to watch the whole thing, but I sure want to watch the rest of the 10 hours. So, I&#8217;m going to try to pull an all nighter. Will it happen? Probably not. Currently, the song that&#8217;s playing is Dead Tree. Ugh, the sound of the bass in this song is seriously gratifying. I&#8217;d rather not go more into my Diru adventures, so I&#8217;ll end it here. Although, you can probably go see some of my Diru woohoo over at <a href="http://twitter.com/erzadel" class="external">my Twitter</a>. Why would you even want to do that though?
