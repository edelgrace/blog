As you may have noticed, I recently took up learning how to crochet. Since March is National Crochet Month, &nbsp;I decided to take part in some of the activities that are being held at Ravelry.

**MCAL (Mystery Crochet Along)**

This is an event that reveals the pattern slowly, clue by clue. The only hint is that it&#8217;s an anigurumi made out of three colours. This will be my first amigurumi so I&#8217;m quite excited but also anxious that it won&#8217;t turn out well.

**Team Catghan**

There is one CAL aimed at making items for donation. I decided to make cat rugs as they seemed to be the easiest of the bunch.

**Bag CAL**

This CAL is pretty simple, just crochet a bag! Any bag, really. I am not sure what kind of bag I want to make. I did see one pattern that is easy but it&#8217;s made entirely of single crochets. A little boring but it&#8217;s doable.
