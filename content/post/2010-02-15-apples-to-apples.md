I&#8217;m really pumped/hyped up/excited for the Kya! effect. Like no joke. Haha. The layout looks suweeeet. I&#8217;m thinking of adopting/renting a domain&#8230; Kya~!

To focus on my offline life&#8230; I just spent four hours at my friend&#8217;s house. Yummy chips, walks to fish creek park, picture taking, and girl talks. 

I have to make sure my band teachers convince my mom about me going to California for our tour this summer. My mom won&#8217;t let me go because it&#8217;s too expensive ($2000) and because she &#8220;can&#8217;t stand it if I left her for ten days.&#8221; The money issue I can understand, but not the second issue. Really? I growing up, you have to let me go some places.
