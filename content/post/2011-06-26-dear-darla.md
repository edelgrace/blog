Right now, it&#8217;s commercial break and I&#8217;m watching _The Little Rascals_. This movie is such a classic. I would always watch it nonstop when I was younger. It&#8217;s almost kinda weird watching it now. I feel like a kid all over again! Except now, I can recite all the words to this movie.

My favourite lines?

_Dear Darla,
  
I hate your stinking guts.
  
You make me vomit.
  
You are scuuuum between my toes.
  
Love, Alfalfa_

That right there is the greatest love note of all history.

On a different note, I&#8217;m due to go to summer school next week. I&#8217;m only taking religion, so it only takes up half the time of normal summer school. All three levels of religion are required to graduate since I go to a Catholic school. Next year, I have no room for it because my schedule&#8217;s all full. So, summer school.

I don&#8217;t really know what I&#8217;m going to do after high school, so I&#8217;m taking all sciences and maths hence my full schedule. What if I finally decide what I want to do, but I don&#8217;t have the required courses to take it in university or college? I guess better safe than sorry. But now I&#8217;m dreading my last year of high school. Fun stuff. Ah well, I&#8217;ll make the best of it. For now, I have summer (after summer school) to look forward to.
