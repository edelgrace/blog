So I like a different guy now. Surprise surprise! Haha. He&#8217;s in my TA&#8230; And he used to go to my junior high school. And another surprise, we&#8217;re actually friends!! AND apparently he likes me back!! That has never happened to me in the history of me.

And because of this I am really happy. And hyper.

Anyway~ Band camp is this week! I am super excited. There is going to be a slave auction and the people who has said that they were going to buy me are so nice and will probably not do anything mean to me. Haha. Toast [guy I like] said that the person who bought him last year made him wear a dress. Aweh.

At this moment I am texting Toast. My most favourite text message I have had from him: &#8220;U make my life thank u&#8230;night&#8221;. :3 Doesn&#8217;t that make you just squeal!! Everyone says we look cute together. Because of the height thing. Haha. Thanks guys&#8230;

I have band practice tomorrow morning (7:30 AM FTW) so I will talk to you later =]
