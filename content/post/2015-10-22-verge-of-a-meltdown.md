When I told my mother I didn&#8217;t want to get married, she said, &#8220;It&#8217;s okay, you&#8217;ll find a nice husband.&#8221; She misinterpreted this and thought I was worried that I wouldn&#8217;t be able to find a husband. While not entirely incorrect, that wasn&#8217;t the main reason. Lately, I had &#8220;men&#8221; (boys, really) falling over my feet. Truth is, I feel like I don&#8217;t deserve the married life, nor would I enjoy it.

I would never want to subject another human being to living the rest of their life with a mess of a human being like me. I&#8217;m spoiled, selfish, quick to anger, lazy, messy, ugly, unhealthy, unmotivated, depressed, anxious, jealous, incompetent, etc., etc. Who would want that? I wouldn&#8217;t want to live with myself either.

Sometimes I&#8217;d think of Yue and think, &#8220;What is he doing with me? What does he want from _us_?&#8221; Recently, we had established that we would just have a &#8220;casual&#8221; relationship. In other words, we were friends with benefits.

All of my &#8220;more than friends&#8221; relationships has always been must that. More than friends, but lacking that small push to be a serious committed relationship.

This little &#8220;break&#8221; from Yue is making me restless. The whole cell phone issue didn&#8217;t help either&#8230; I kept getting error messages when I tried to send him a text. Turns out that his contact was linked with Skype, which gave the wrong phone number. Anyway. He&#8217;s on my mind more than I&#8217;d like. I crave his touch, his voice, just the sight of him. Yesterday, I did manage to see him for a second. And I was so happy for a second.

Then there&#8217;s the issue of Tyler. This guy likes me. I **want** to like him&#8230; But I just can&#8217;t. We get along so well. Why don&#8217;t I like him?? Is it because I&#8217;m &#8220;with&#8221; Yue right now? I don&#8217;t know what to think&#8230; I&#8217;ve never gotten along with someone so well before. But lately, I&#8217;m finding myself a little irritated with Tyler, for the smallest things. I can&#8217;t believe he texted me, &#8220;when are you going to make time for me?&#8221; That totally just rubbed me the wrong way&#8230; Like he&#8217;s entitled to me? Like I&#8217;m obligated to spending time with him? Don&#8217;t get me wrong with the whole sweetie, sweet tea thing.

My love life is so confusing right now.
