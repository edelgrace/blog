Guess what?

He&#8217;s dating someone.

Whoot, whoot. I mean&#8230; I&#8217;m glad he told me. I&#8217;m glad I found out from HIM. He said that I was one of the first people he told. So I&#8217;m happy he trusts me.

But&#8230; I&#8217;m still jealous. I mean, she&#8217;s so nice and she told me she was sorry&#8230; I can&#8217;t help it.

And, he said he knew I was pretending to be happy.
  
I&#8217;m not pretending.
  
I&#8217;m trying to be.

Because he looks so happy holding her hand, laughing with her&#8230; I just have to smile. I&#8217;d rather have him be happy.

I&#8217;ve been trying to rid of myself of him since she came into the picture, cause I knew this was the inevitable.

I cried in her arms on Saturday.
  
He wants to talk to me on Monday.

Tara tells me to not turn into a David Carpenter going emo over one person. I won&#8217;t. I hope. XP

\*sigh\*

About site things! I&#8217;m making a new layout. For the site to use. And another for like&#8230; resources.

This post has a lot of spaces/line breaks in them. XD

Well, wish me luck.

Night =]
