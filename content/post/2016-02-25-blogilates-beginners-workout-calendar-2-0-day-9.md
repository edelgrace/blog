### Day 9: Abs

### Video 1: Total Body Workout

I&#8217;m not going to list the moves for this video again because my comments are mostly the same from the last time I did this video. I really am progressing with those pull ups. Not once did I have to grab my legs! However I do rely on my momentum more rather than my core, but still. This might be old news but I still hate the hundred move&#8230; It totally hurts my neck and I know I&#8217;m doing it wrong but I just can&#8217;t do it right, yet.

### Video 2: ABC Abs

I won&#8217;t list the moves to this video either because there are only two moves. The first one is a position where you have to draw letters in your air using your arms. It&#8217;s hard because it&#8217;s in a Pilates stance. I had to pause a couple of times to regain my composure. The second move is the same thing but with the legs and different positioning. My tailbone really bothers me a lot when it comes to these exercise. So I struggled doing this one as well, but not as much as I did with the first one.

### Thoughts

My overall thoughts for today? I hate ABC Abs, haha! I think they are the hardest moves so far in this calendar. It now feels like I&#8217;ve been doing it forever but it&#8217;s only day nine! Time flies&#8230; Can I just fast forward to the end where I&#8217;m string and fit and can eat cheat food!
