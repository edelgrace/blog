Okay, I&#8217;ve decided that [Room 304][1] is now officially a book log/archive with minimal blog posts. This calls for a redesign that will emphasize the fact. Why the change? It was always my intention to have Room 304 solely as a book log. But as I heard about book blogging, I decided I would give it a chance. It overshadowed the logging aspect of the site, and I didn&#8217;t feel like I wanted to update the site anymore. So yes, a &#8220;new&#8221; focus for Room 304!

That being said, the blogging part is **not** going away. However, it definitely will not be frequent. I&#8217;ll just be posting the books I&#8217;ve bought and/or borrowed from the library. Sometimes I&#8217;ll do stuff like Follow Fridays (minus the following) and other memes like that but those will be even rarer. So yes. My library haul for the month!

I actually took these books out on the 9th. I&#8217;ve neglected to post about it but better late than never! I&#8217;m actually returning a few of them today. In fact, I&#8217;ve finished reading all of the books except one. Mind you, 80% of the books are manga and/or are &#8220;easy&#8221; reads.

So here&#8217;s the list!

  * **Message from an Unknown Chinese Mother: Stories of Loss and Love by Xinran**  
    While I was doing my daily browsing of all the aisles in the library, I came across this little gem! I wanted to take it out before, but I felt like I had too many books on my plate. So I came back and got it now!
  * **Alcestis by Katharine Beutner**  
    This caught my eye right away because I really love Greek myths. Especially anything to do with the Underworld. Hades you beast. And poor, sweet, dear, precious <del>fefeta</del> Persephone.
  * **Assassin&#8217;s Creed: Forsaken by Oliver Bowden**  
    As soon as I realized that the library actually had Assassin&#8217;s Creed books, I had to grab them! I&#8217;ve heard about this book among the fandom and a lot of people love it. Mostly because Haytham is in it? Seeing as how it&#8217;s a journal of pretty much his entire life, I was intrigued. I also can&#8217;t bear to miss any piece of canon media.
  * **Assassin&#8217;s Creed: Renaissance by Oliver Bowden**  
    Saw this one right next to Forsaken. No regrets.
  * **Kimi Ni Todoke (Volumes 1-7) by Karuho Shiina**  
    This series has been on my to-read list for the looongest time. It&#8217;s almost been over three years, actually! I&#8217;ve put it off because it&#8217;s licensed in English (I know, I&#8217;m horrible). As soon as I saw several volumes starting from the very beginning, I grabbed them all.
  * **Cirque du Freak (Volumes 8-12) by Darren Shan and Takahiro Arai**  
    Okay, I&#8217;ve been reading this series for around two years. These are the final volumes. I just have to finish what I started!
  * **The Limit (Volumes 1 & 2) by Keiko Suenobu**  
    I&#8217;m a big fan of Keiko Suenobu. I&#8217;ve read most of her series, _Life_ and a couple of her works. I&#8217;ve always had a soft spot for over dramatic high school kids. On a more serious note, Suenobu loves to focus on bullying and I just love the awareness she&#8217;s trying to spread. She&#8217;s always a good read!
