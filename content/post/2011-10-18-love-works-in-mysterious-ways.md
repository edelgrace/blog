This morning I woke up at seven because I needed to buy batteries for my calculator. It turns out that I had a pack of new batteries in my room. Lol, awkward.

So, I got to school. Walked a bit with Shannon and Aiden. Circled the school a couple of times. Creeped on Ms Gratton and Ms Dunn (Ms Dunn was carrying Starbucks into her room with Mr Ottenbreit while singing happy birthday).

We walked past Brad&#8217;s group. And he said &#8220;Edellllll&#8221;. I find him so cute idk why. I also saw Kenneth (finger pointing shooting guy) like three times.

In spare I peacefully studied for physics.

During TA I had a good conversation with Brad. Idk why but HE&#8217;S SO CUTE. He&#8217;s not even THAT good looking but aweh, he just melts my heart.

Here&#8217;s our convo.

Brad: I love my hair today. My hairline is on the middle, so I can flip it anyway I want.
  
Me: Haha, that&#8217;s cool.
  
-some small talk-
  
Brad: Is Shannon dating Aiden?
  
Me: Yeah. I find it a bit weird but whoever she likes, she&#8217;ll date.
  
Brad: Mhm. Well, love works in mysterious ways. &#8211;_I found this so cute that I couldn&#8217;t help but smile omg_&#8211;
  
Brad: Something&#8217;s wrong with me, I can&#8217;t have a relationship for more than two months and a half.
  
Me: Well, you&#8217;re just in high school.
  
Brad: Still, I don&#8217;t understand how some people can last 9 months or a year. I just last two and a half months.
  
Me: My first and only relationship lasted two and a half months. He was in grade twelve when I was I grade ten.
  
Brad: Was he in band?
  
Me: Yeah, he played tuba.
  
Brad: What was his name?
  
Me: Dylan.
  
Brad: Oh. I&#8217;ve heard storie about him.
  
Me: Like, druggie stories?
  
Brad: Yeah.
  
Me: It was so embarrassing. Everytime someone mentions it to me, I&#8217;m like no, shut up. It was such a mistake.
  
Brad: Did you go to post?
  
Me: Yeah but not post post, because he was there. He would have been drunk and I would have been like fuck you.
  
Brad: I see. Yeah, durin post post everyone was like drunk and stuff. Conrad was acting crazy and stuff. I was just taking care of everyone.

Math was interesting. We start a new unit. Whoo~ And our test was moved to Thursday because tomorrow is Friday schedule because of parent teacher interviews. Yay! More time to study.
