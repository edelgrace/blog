Before spare started, I went to the cafeteria with Sarah. While we were there, she was talking about Brad. Ack. Brad. She was saying how it just wasn&#8217;t working at all. That they never hung out and that Brad was really awkwarrrrd around her. Oh my. In the back of my head I was just like, &#8220;But they were such a good couple, the best choice in boys Sarah had yet!&#8221;

Because there was Mitchell before Brad. Ugh. Mitchell. He&#8217;s a good guy and all but he&#8217;s a little bit of a creep. I imagine he&#8217;s like Tristan (Pinoy kind). Desperate for a girlfriend and ultimately, desperate for sex. Yeah, that&#8217;s the vibe I get from him.

Anyway, in TA we had TA snack. Ms. Ricketts baked us yummy cake/brownies. It was really messy since we had to use our mouths. During math I was getting it everywhere. Yuck!

I did a quiz in chemistry. First quiz of the year, whoot! I think I did pretty good. I hope so anyway, haha.
