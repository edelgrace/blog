I was freaking out because lol I look like shit and I&#8217;m unprepared for this exam and I didn&#8217;t want senpai to witness all of this. It was a biiiig relief to know that he wasn&#8217;t there. I could write my exam in peace and not worry about looking like an idiot in front of him! Downside is that I wished I saw him at least one more time before the new year. :( I need to figure out when Chinese New Year is next year I&#8217;ll have to give him his chocolates then. :) He&#8217;s so cute. :(
