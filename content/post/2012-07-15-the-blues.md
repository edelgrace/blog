I have the blues. It&#8217;s this thing that comes along every couple of weeks. The sudden realization that wow, I really have no friends. I can&#8217;t tell anyone anything anymore. Mostly because I don&#8217;t like sounding like a whiny baby and because no one really cares. Ugh, I sound like and emo person.

And when I think about my lack of social skills, I just want to crawl into a hole and die. How will I get a job? How will I find my future husband? How will I ever start a family? There goes three of my goals in life. I want nothing more than to be loved, start a family, and have a decent paying job. I don&#8217;t know. I feel hopeless.

Especially with university now. I&#8217;m lost. I don&#8217;t know what I want to do. I know that I&#8217;m definitely not going into engineering anymore. I&#8217;m sure my physics diploma didn&#8217;t do very well. Or my English. And people say, &#8220;Some people aren&#8217;t meant to go to university.&#8221; Fuck them, I&#8217;m supposed to go to university. Because school is the only thing I know. I can&#8217;t function without school.

Just&#8230; Blah. I&#8217;ve never been so&#8230; Unmotivated in my life. When I think about all the things I am doing, it&#8217;s just all stupid. I just want to get lost in a different world and never come back. I don&#8217;t like reality.
