Tomorrow I start university. Thank goodness for Labour day. I&#8217;ve never really understood what Labour day is. All I know is that it delays school by one more day and that&#8217;s all I need to know to be thankful for it. To be honest, I&#8217;m not at all that excited to be honest. Technically, classes don&#8217;t start until next week so that&#8217;s delayed even further.

This week is all orientation. Basically, just having fun and getting to know the campus and mingling with other potential classmates. It&#8217;s all really well organized, from what I&#8217;ve seen so far. You have to register and everything and you get put into groups based on what you&#8217;re taking. Thankfully, I know one other person in my group. However, that&#8217;s also a bad thing in a way. I&#8217;m more likely to cling and not socialize at all if I know someone else. We&#8217;ll have to see about that.

So this week&#8217;s events include tours, games, sport events, going to IKEA (yeah, IKEA, I&#8217;m not kidding), and more. There&#8217;s a lot to do this week, I&#8217;m somewhat overwhelmed but somewhat excited. Excited because it sounds extremely fun and overwhelmed because ugh, people.

This summer I&#8217;ve been staying at home like a boring person. I haven&#8217;t interacted with my friends since Stampede week and that was the first week of July. It&#8217;s the first week of September. I&#8217;m so accustomed to being cooped up into my room. I might get shocked by being surrounded by a scarily large amount of people (3243 people and counting to be exact). I&#8217;m nervous. I get such weird anxiety around people. Last Saturday I was freaking out over picking up my textbooks. It went smoothly but I was shaking a little bit. Hopefully that won&#8217;t happen at all this week.

So yes, my last day of freedom. I&#8217;m going to spend it on Tumblr and talking to people on Facebook. Well, at least that&#8217;s the plan. What do I even do on my last day of freedom? All I know is that I&#8217;m going to bed super duper early because transit sucks&#8230;
