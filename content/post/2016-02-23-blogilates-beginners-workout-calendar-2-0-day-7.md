### Day 7: Rest Day

Thank goodness for the rest day. Technically there is 30 minutes left of day 7 and I feel like I should be doing something. So I&#8217;m searching for some quick videos to do before midnight hits. I can&#8217;t believe I&#8217;ve done a week of this already! Here&#8217;s to four more weeks!

### Video 1: Two Ingredient Banana Pancakes

I didn&#8217;t try these mostly because I had ate all of my calories by the time I got to doing the calendar. I&#8217;ve heard many mixed reviews about these &#8220;pancakes.&#8221; They&#8217;re simply just eggs and banana fried together. It sounds really weird and I&#8217;m doubting whether or not they actually taste good. I&#8217;m a horrible cook but I would like to try them one day.

### Video 2: Quiet Cardio Workout (FitnessBlender)

Okay, today I cheated. Today is a &#8220;rest day&#8221; after all! I didn&#8217;t feel good about not doing any workouts today. I had to do something, at least. It&#8217;s nearly midnight now and I decided to do a quiet workout since most of the house is asleep. There are 10 exercises in this workout, repeated twice for a total of around 20 minutes.

</div>

  * _4 Torso Twists & 2 Kicks:_ This is an easy move but it got my heart pumping right away!
  * _X Squats:_ I hate X squats so much! They&#8217;re not hard but really tiring. I was breathing pretty heavily at this point.
  * _Deadlift Jacks:_ I actually like this one except I didn&#8217;t have enough room to do them in my office (AKA my study room). I tried my best though, and ended up making weird angles.
  * _Up & Over Steps and Knees:_ This is another easy one but kind of difficult to do it quietly! I like how these workouts emphasize how quiet you&#8217;re trying to be.
  * _Slow Squats & Hooks:_ Okay, I hate these too! Do you see a trend here? Squats and planks are not my friends. It kinda feel fun to be punching the air though&#8230;
  * _Quiet Burpees:_ I did these earlier in the week when one of the days required burpees. It was kind of cheating but I really needed to be quiet that day because I usually exercise at night when everyone is sleeping/falling asleep.
  * _Arm & Leg Balance Swings:_ This is an easy exercise. I just have no balance sometimes. I really tried to focus on contracting my arms and legs but I keep forgetting about my core.
  * _3 Twists & Knee Ups:_ I always get confused with the rhythm of this move and I get behind compared to the person on the screen. I think I&#8217;m tempted to do four twists instead of three.
  * _Plank Tucks & Extensions:_ Planks!!!! My number one enemy. Admittedly, these are the easiest variation of planks that I&#8217;ve done this week. I really hate planks. Maybe one day I can do them without complaining&#8230;
  * _Low Lateral Steps:_ This &#8220;completely depends on how quiet you are.&#8221; Seriously. Go too fast and you make a lot of noise whenever you put your feet to the ground. I always feel myself gaining momentum. At least the workout ends on an easy note.

### Thoughts

&#8220;Rest day.&#8221; I think every rest day I will still exercise for maybe ten to twenty minutes with someone other than Cassey. Maybe next week I&#8217;ll actually try her recipes because I&#8217;ve been so hungry lately!

With the cardio workout, I felt like I sweat buckets. It was almost as if I sweat more in this twenty minutes than the entire week! To be fair, there isn&#8217;t a lot of cardio in Cassey&#8217;s workouts. They mostly focus on strength and toning. I&#8217;d like to include more cardio into my week. I already have a spin class every week which is just once a week for 50 minutes. Cassey does sometimes include some cardio but I feel like it&#8217;s not enough.

Also, they say that workouts should make you feel awake but as soon as the workout was over, I became instantly tired. Time to hit the hay I guess. I also probably need to eat more whenever I do cardio&#8230;
