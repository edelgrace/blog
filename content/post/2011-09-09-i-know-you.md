This morning I had band practice. It was pretty cool. We met all the juniors. Before practice I saw Corey&#8217;s little sister, Sydney. The conversation went a little like this.

Me: You&#8217;re Corey&#8217;s sister, right?
  
Sydney: Yeah!
  
Me: It&#8217;s me, Edel!
  
Sydney: Mikayla, it&#8217;s Edel!

Aweeehhh. Also.

Tristan, this cute baby faced grade eleven who plays vas clarinet thought I was in grade ten. Lol. Awkward.

And. One grade ten flute, Laura, thought I had lots of confidence. Lolz.

So yeah.

That&#8217;s pretty much all that went on today.
