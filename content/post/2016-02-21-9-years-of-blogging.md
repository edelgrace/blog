Okay, I know that probably isn&#8217;t a lot compared to other bloggers out there but to me, that&#8217;s mind blowing. 9 years is around 40% of my life and that percentage will only keep on increasing. Assuming that I continue blogging. As long as I can type, I don&#8217;t think I would stop blogging. Sure, my blogging might be extremely sporadic but it&#8217;s still blogging to me.

Actually, I was going through my archive and I read [a blog post][1] that was from exactly six years and two days ago. That&#8217;s **3289** days ago. I laughed to myself abouut how some things just don&#8217;t change.

_&#8220;I haven&#8217;t posted in a while.&#8221;_ This is me like every single time I post something. How is this still true even today? &#8220;I need to post more,&#8221; I say to myself every year.

_&#8220;I&#8217;m too much of a perfectionist.&#8221;_ My second most fatal flaw. My first being that I&#8217;m a procrastinator, which I&#8217;m 99.9% sure that I was one back then. It&#8217;s honestly the deadliest combination against productivity.

_&#8220;My mom keeps complaining on how Iâ€™m &#8216;losing weight.'&#8221;_ I literally got into a (civil) argument with my mom about my weight yesterday. I&#8217;ve been trying to get toned (hence all the recent fitness posts) because I have always been conscious of my large gut. I&#8217;m at a perfect weight for my height I just want to reduce my body fat percentage to get that flat stomach look. They say doing so is 80% diet and 20% exercise. I don&#8217;t mind gaining weight through muscles.

_&#8220;Live performances always rekindle my love for a band.&#8221;_ Just recently I&#8217;ve been **obsessed** with the post-hardcore Canadian band Alexisonfire. This was because, by some chance, I watched an hour long concert on YouTube of theirs from last year. It was mind blowing how perfect they were in that concert. I used to like Alexisonfire a lot when I was in junior high but watching this concert made my love for them grow tenfold. I never realized how great they were as a band.

_&#8220;I am so tired right now.&#8221;_ They say nine years later that she is still tired today.
