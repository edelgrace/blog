Comments: Somewhat based on my experiences from the Philippines. I based End Of Holding On on this. ^^ I might have more, but I&#8217;m not sure I want to post it. Hands are on my mind lately&#8230;  
Synopsis: This is only a temporary affair&#8230;There&#8217;s an end to everything. Even when you&#8217;re holding hands.

I could feel your eyes on me as I stroked your palm; carefully tracing the intricate creases. A pretty design of curves, stars, and criss-crosses that no one else in the entire world had.And I wish they could belong to me.

You curl your hand around my forefinger. It&#8217;s so warm, sending tingles through my hand and up my arm.&#8221;Your fingers are small,&#8221; you whisper. &#8220;I think it&#8217;s because you&#8217;re so short.&#8221; Your grin is teasing.

Blushing, I pry your hand open and place mine against yours. I&#8217;m shocked at how pale I am against you. Your skin is a delicious shade of light brown, soft and smooth. Fingertips extending beyond my own. Unreachable. Maybe it was a sign.

But then you swiftly brush my cheek with the back of your palm. Heat sears up my neck; my face turning red.

&#8220;Soft,&#8221; You say, with another one of your teasing grins. Slowly you stand up and ruffle my hair. &#8220;I gotta go now, okay?&#8221;

I nod silently, my eyes looking past your head.

&#8220;Good night,&#8221; Your voice shrinks to a whisper. &#8220;See you tomorrow.&#8221;

&#8220;Good night,&#8221; I reply, wrapping my arms around my self.

I watch you walk away, and fade into the night. The porch light suddenly dims.The stars laugh as the twinkle against the black sky. As if saying &#8220;You only get him for a few days, but we can watch him all day. Everyday. Forever.&#8221;

That&#8217;s when I realize how lucky I am, just to even know you exist.
