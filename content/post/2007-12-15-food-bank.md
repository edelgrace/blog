Today, my TA went to the church across the street to help out with the food hampers. Our job was to bring all 200 something boxes from the basement to the main floor. Do you know how hard that is? It was definitely a workout for me. I got my friend pat to help me with over half of my boxes and he calls me lazy. There was this freight elevator, and we had to bring carts full of food with it. It was so sketchy and small, and dark. Although, it was hilarious. Once, we had to cram 8 kids in there (it looked like it should fit one shopping cart in there) and then, someone farted. Junior high shenanigans right there.
