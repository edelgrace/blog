Tomorrow is the graduation ceremonies for the grade twelves. The marching band is playing, AKA me. I&#8217;m super nervous. Not nervous if performing but nervous of crying. I&#8217;m going to miss a lot of these grade twelves.

I&#8217;m going to miss him. Even more than I do now. But this will hopefully help me get over him. It&#8217;s been over a month. A month. =/ I&#8217;m surprised I lasted this long with only one minor breakdown. I miss him so much. My heart aches and my stomach drops at the sight of him, the sound of him, even hearing his name.

Love is cruel.
