Christmas break is here and so is a new layout. It&#8217;s not my own, but I was just enamored by it&#8217;s simplicity. Enjoy! Whew, I finally made it through my very first semester in university. I must say, it was quite a ride. I&#8217;m glad I got through it. Finals are behind me and now I can just relax. Even though I do want to take this time to chill out and slow down the pace, I also want to be productive. I know, I know. What is there to be productive for? School&#8217;s done for the semester! I&#8217;ve actually got a couple of things that I want to accomplish during the break. In fact, I&#8217;ve actually done a couple of those things already.

## Get my ID

I don&#8217;t have an ID yet, mainly because I haven&#8217;t bothered getting my drivers permit. I&#8217;m really far behind on that, maybe this summer I&#8217;ll get it (I say that all summer, every summer). Not having an ID is quite concerning, considering that I&#8217;ll be 18 before the year ends. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m a clubbing or party person, but I don&#8217;t want to be caught in a situation where I need an ID and I don&#8217;t have it. Plus, I&#8217;m pretty sure there has to be some law out there saying that I need to have one on my person at all times.

## Renew my library card

I&#8217;m definitely getting my library card renewed! After I get my ID, that is. Once I&#8217;m legally an adult, I need photo ID to renew my library card. I can no longer rely on my parents to provide that information for me (sad face). Going along with the theme of libraries, I want to work at the library. It doesn&#8217;t have to be at a public library but any library would be good. I wish I had pushed harder for working at a university library when there was an opening there. My parents didn&#8217;t want me working during university but now I&#8217;m going to try a bit harder to convince them otherwise.

## Clean out all of my e-mail inboxes

I don&#8217;t even know how or why I accumulate as much e-mail as I do. I have around five e-mail accounts, not including all of my admin@domain.com e-mails. Prior to deleting all the unimportant e-mails, each of my accounts had around 1,000 to 2,000 (unread) e-mails, not including the ones that I **have** read. It&#8217;s kind of crazy. Plus there&#8217;s all the folders that I had to go through to weed out things that are out of date, and such. Call me crazy or not, but I actually did this all of yesterday. Thank goodness for the &#8220;sweep&#8221; and &#8220;filter&#8221; functions in Hotmail and Gmail. Who knew that I had 300+ e-mails from Tumblr telling me &#8220;x&#8221; person followed me, liked this, reblogged that, asked this, and replied to that?

## Forwarding all of my e-mail to one account

Having more than five accounts across multiple domains is tough to keep track out. I migrated all of my e-mails to one account on Gmail. Gmail&#8217;s filters is awesome for sorting mail into different labels so I can know which e-mail came from where. Plus, it&#8217;s pretty easy to forward mail too! The only thing I have to do left is to forward all of my university mail, but for some reason it isn&#8217;t working. I&#8217;ll have to work on that later.

## Catch up (at least a little bit) with my book log

To those who don&#8217;t know, I have a [book log][1]{.external}. I&#8217;m seriously so far behind with it! On [Goodreads][2]{.external} I have just over 1,200 books on my profile. I have 52 books logged in my book log. If this was Tumblr, I&#8217;d insert an obligatory \*shrieks and flies into the sun\* somewhere into this paragraph. I&#8217;m hoping to at least get a hundred books into the database before the Christmas break is over.

## Website clean up

There&#8217;s nothing like taking out some time to do some website clean up. I have so many websites, and I really need to consolidate everything because quite frankly, I don&#8217;t have time for all of them (not that I did in the first place, haha). I&#8217;ve narrowed it down to two websites and two other websites that require very little maintenance. Right now I have around around eight or nine. Yeah, some of those got to go!

## Hush hush project

One of the four websites that I&#8217;m keeping will actually be a new website. That means I&#8217;m letting go of five or six of my current websites. I don&#8217;t want to say too much about the website now, but I can guarantee that it will be up on New Years!
