In a way, I don&#8217;t want to read stories about (romantic) love anymore. Too much emphasis is put on love, whether it be on screen, in print, or just in life in general. Not that I&#8217;m saying that love isn&#8217;t important, because it is important. How a character approaches love can speak volumes about their personality. But I just don&#8217;t want it to be the main plot, or even a sub-plot. I just want love to be there. Just let it happen or note that it has happened already.

Love drives us but it isn&#8217;t the only thing that drives us. Sometimes it&#8217;s survival, sometimes it&#8217;s the desire for status, sometimes it&#8217;s our family, and sometime&#8217;s it just not love.

Let&#8217;s hear different stories. I want to hear stories of personal struggles that do not revolve around not being able to get laid. I&#8217;m not invalidating those struggles but I am tired of hearing it, of seeing it, and of reading it. I want to hear adventures in faraway lands that may or may not be real. I want to hear tales of fantasy. I want to experience something more than just love.

I guess all it boils down to is that love is overrated and while important, it&#8217;s still not as important as we think it is.
