As a Catholic, I&#8217;m always working towards understanding my faith, living my faith, properly representing my faith, and lately: being in harmony with those who do not share my faith. A couple of years ago, I was an ignorant little brat, believing myself better than others who didn&#8217;t actually identify as Catholic despite going to a Catholic school. That mentality quickly faded away once high school began but that didn&#8217;t mean that I became &#8220;any less Catholic.&#8221;

I tried my best to keep a delicate balance between my more secular values and my, well, not so secular values. It&#8217;s hard. I still try to do this today. More often than not, my secular values seem to dominate over everything else but I still have this longing to grow in my faith and fully live it out.

Earlier on this semester, the campus bookstore was having a hallway sale. It was my break time, I had nothing better to do and the prices seemed cheap enough, so I went ahead and browsed for around half an hour. There were a couple of books that intrigued me but there was one book that kept me coming back to it. &#8220;Through the Narrow Gate: Life In and Out of the Convent&#8221; by Karen Armstrong.

This book is a memoir of Armstrong&#8217;s first 20 or so years of her life. In this journey we see her as a child, a young teenaged girl, a nun, and then back to a child. Despite the fact that the back of the book advertised the author&#8217;s falling out Catholicism and/or the convent, I bought it anyway. It was a great read and I completely fell in love with Ms. Armstrong&#8217;s writing.

Recently, I downloaded Apple&#8217;s &#8220;iTunes U&#8221; app for my iPod, hoping to find some interesting stuff about engineering and/or librarianship. I was quickly thrown off track with TED talks. Quickly browsing through some of their &#8220;courses&#8221; I decided to download &#8220;Understanding Islam.&#8221; One of my favourite videos in this course is &#8220;The Charter for Compassion.&#8221;

Once I saw Armstrong&#8217;s face appeared on the screen, I did not know it was her but I did know that she looked familiar. As she did her little intro and started talking in her English accent (in _Through the Narrow Gate_ she mentions going to Oxford), I noticed her immediately.

In &#8220;The Charter for Compassion&#8221; Ms. Armstrong first talks about her fascination with Islam. She notes the similarities or the references Islam has with Christianity. Here comes the zinger: Ms. Armstrong then suggests that all religions expresses tolerance towards each other and therefore, she is launching. a &#8220;charter for compassion&#8221; that is devoted to uniting people of all faiths. It will promote true compassion towards the other and just being a decent human being.

Ms. Armstrong&#8217;s vision is beautiful. Unfortunately, it is not realistic **_but we can come close to it._** If only the whole world could look upon other religions with the same curiosity and respect that she does.
