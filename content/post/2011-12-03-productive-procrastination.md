Today I procrastinated but it ended up with me doing something productive but it still wasn&#8217;t something that I shouldn&#8217;t be doing. Today I finished designing for my future fansite and/or fanlisting (I have yet to be approved) for Yukihiro Awaji, the drummer for the Japanese band L&#8217;Arc~en~Ciel. It&#8217;s quite simple but I&#8217;m okay with it. I have yet to code it though.

I also finished designing and coding a new layout for Pure Orenji. It took me two days, phew! There are still some minor tweaks but those will be fixed later. I&#8217;m going to add new pages to Pure Orenji but that won&#8217;t happen until either Christmas or Spring break.

Tomorrow I&#8217;m going to turn off the computer and study. I have three tests to do next week, ouch.
