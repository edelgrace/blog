These days, most people are going paperless. With things like &#8220;the cloud&#8221; and thousands of web and mobile apps that can do almost anything you want, it wouldn&#8217;t be hard. However, I&#8217;m going the opposite way. I&#8217;m going back to paper.

### Why on earth would I possibly want to do this?

Easy. Smartphones, while useful, also carry a lot of temptations. Sure, you can have 10 note-taking, productivity, schedule apps but you also have an Internet browser, a music player, and quite possibly, a nice library of games. For me, that is a huge con that outweighs any pros. I admit that I lack discipline, especially when it comes to technology. Adding to that, I&#8217;m also a huge procrastinator. While I don&#8217;t game a lot on my phone, it still has the Internet. Once I&#8217;m on the Internet, I don&#8217;t resurface for hours. All of those apps I just downloaded to help me? They&#8217;re forgotten as soon as I click on Chrome.

### How exactly am I going to go back to paper?

I love stationary. I&#8217;ve always been obsessed with stationary. When I was younger, I&#8217;d always be designing and fantasizing about my dream notebooks. One was like an accordion, each side had a pad for different things. For example, addresses, diary, calendar, sketching, etc. My dreams are somewhat coming true, with the lovely invention called the binder. Now, I&#8217;ve been debating on whether not to buy a [mini binder][1]{.external} and make a DIY planner or to buy a ready made [Filofax][2]{.external} with some DIY elements. The former is definitely way more cheaper, but a Filofax can also double as a wallet and I&#8217;m always up for multi-purpose things (except for smartphones). Plus, Filofaxes are soooo pretty. I&#8217;ve been drooling over them for quite a while now. Except they&#8217;re so expensive. Ah!

Meanwhile, I have a day per page DayMinder that works just fine. It has a lot of space to write on, which is great. At the same time though, it&#8217;s still summer and I don&#8217;t have that much to write down. It&#8217;s still pretty great. I&#8217;m trying to get into the habit of planning my day out now before school starts. Also, I&#8217;m practicing my writing because I haven&#8217;t hand written anything in three months. Ouch! I think it&#8217;s working. Hopefully it will benefit me in the long run.
