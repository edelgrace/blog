### Day 23: Abs

Okay I&#8217;m pretty behind. It&#8217;s now past midnight, I should be doing day 25 today. I&#8217;m waking up early tomorrow so I&#8217;ll have to skip out on catching up on day 24 until later in the day. Yesterday (two days ago?) I came home late with a huge head ache and immediately fell asleep. Like I came home, fell on my bed, and went to sleep! My headache was brutal.

### Video 1: Total Body Workout

These are getting easier with every video! Except for those hundreds. I still can&#8217;t do them without pausing. One day I will get there (I say that every time). The leg moves were a little bit tougher today (just by a smidgen) since I had my cycling class today.

### Video 2: 6 Minutes to a Sexy Little Waist

This video wasn&#8217;t that bad.

  * _Rainbow Oblique:_ A really interesting move. I felt like I over compensated with this move because I only felt it in my legs and not in my obliques. Also, Cassey looks so graceful doing this move but I&#8217;m sure I looked like a mess doing it!
  * _Windshield Wipers:_ Another one that I felt I wasn&#8217;t doing properly. But I did feel a burn, just not in the side. My legs totally felt this one.
  * _Waist Whittlers:_ I find these really hard! I could not do these with the modification. And it took a while to actually get it properly. These killed me!

### Video 3: Quick Ab Workout

&#8220;Quick.&#8221; It felt like eternity! I&#8217;m not a huge fan of long repetitions, I really like it when there&#8217;s variety in the moves. This video is essentially two move: double leg lift and criss cross. The double leg lift was hard and I could not do it without the beginner&#8217;s modification. My back keeps wanting to arch and create that hollow. When I tried to flatten my back out, I definitely felt my abs. Which is what was supposed to happen! As for the criss cross, I could only do four without feeling pain already. I had to pause a couple of times but strangely, I found these easier to do.
