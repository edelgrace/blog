Yes, I&#8217;m all alone on this five day long weekend. My parents have banned me from going anywhere with my friends. Ahh great. I&#8217;ll be alone on Valentines day D:

Anyway, I keep saying I will do things but my parents want me off the computer more and more. =/ I&#8217;m currently downloading my homework (a worksheet posted on my school website&#8230;haha).

So what&#8217;s up with everyone?

I&#8217;m really tired and bored. It&#8217;s only day 2 of 5.

Happy Valentines day!
