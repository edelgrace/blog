AJ reminds me of Kemal. As much as I&#8217;d hate to say it, that&#8217;s the number one reason why I find AJ so attractive. He&#8217;s like the Korean version of Kemal. Also, I&#8217;d rather fangirl over AJ than be madly crushing on a guy who probably thinks I&#8217;m an idiot and who I haven&#8217;t seen in almost a year.

However, I saw Kemal on campus a while ago and I realized how much they don&#8217;t really look like each other. Just the overall idea of their faces are similar. I think Kemal is more handsome while AJ is more pretty boy cute. They both have beautifully cheekbones though. :( I&#8217;m a sucker for nice cheekbones&#8230;

It&#8217;s probably my memory being rusty but I feel like they have similar accents too. Kemal&#8217;s accent is more Russian and thicker. But they sound very similar! When I watch their lips, they both make the same movements when they speak. It&#8217;s freaky. I need to hang out with Kemal again to really get a good comparison of the two.

But seriously though. AJ is perfect.
