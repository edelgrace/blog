This morning, when I got to band, Sam told me that Shannon was walking around hyperventilating. I freaked out inside because I was just like, &#8220;IF AIDEN HURT(ED? omg what is grammar?) SHANNON I WILL KILL HIM.&#8221;

I caught up to Shannon. Her eyes were wet and her face was red. I tried to slow her down and then she slammed a locker. She likes Voldemort or at least, she thinks she does.

I felt bad, but I was just like, &#8220;Voldemort? Really?&#8221; Voldemort is her ex who is just extremely messed up. She&#8217;s those typical &#8220;emo&#8221; chicks who says she&#8217;s bi just to sleep around with numerous people of both genders at the same time. I think she was using Shannon when they were first dating.

I just&#8230; I CAN&#8217;T EVEN. I was worried that Aiden like raped her or something. If that happened, I would have for sure slapped a baby (but not really).

Well, during hand we played the show opener a couple of times. I actually enjoy it. The last five bars are so pretty.

In spare I &#8220;studied&#8221; for my chem test. I checked my mark an hour ago and I got an 80% on it. I thought I seriously failed it. Thank goodness.

In TA, Brad didn&#8217;t show up. I was just like ASDFGHJKL WHERE IS MY TA BUDDY?

In math we did review. Fuuuuuuuuun. But not really.

In math we kinda did review. I discovered that my calculator ran out of batteries so I had to &#8220;go to the washroom&#8221; to text people for their calculators. Alara gave me hers, lol.

Yeah the chem test. I though I failed. I&#8217;m so glad I got 80% but at the same time, I&#8217;m just like IT&#8217;S ONLY 80%. I&#8217;m so lame&#8230;

After school we played the show opener again and Jazz Police. We didn&#8217;t get to test because we played right until 4:30 PM. Oh Riegel.

At the bus stop, I confessed to Shannon that I may like Brad. Which is true. I may like him. I mean, he&#8217;s so cute, has a sweet personality, and just so friendly and hilarious and sweet and gahhh. To be honest, when I saw Brad at summer school and I asked him if he had a tour fling and he said it was Sarah, I felt a twinge of jealousy.

When they broke up, I couldn&#8217;t help but feel a bit relieved.

But he dumped her to date this other chick which was a no-no.

But the whole drugs thing.

But the cutting thing.

But he&#8217;s in grade eleven.

But he&#8217;s a flirt.

But he might like someone else.

But the fact that he&#8217;s my best friend&#8217;s ex.

I want to fall out of like with him, and fast.
