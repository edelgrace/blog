Okay I&#8217;m so angry, I wrote this entire post out in the &#8220;Quick Draft&#8221; section of my dashboard, clicked &#8220;Save Draft&#8221; and then when I came back, what I wrote was erased. :( This happens a lot but not enough for me to remember to save entries locally before I publish&#8230; I&#8217;ll try my best to recreate what I just wrote. I&#8217;m still really salty, haha.

In my [previous post][1], I mentioned that I was moving from [Bootstrap][2] to [Foundation][3]. I even applied the theme to my [study blog][4]. I don&#8217;t really know where I got the motivation to finally do this. Maybe it&#8217;s because school is approaching way to quickly and I wanted to do something productive for once. Over the summer I&#8217;ve been planning all the projects that I want to accomplish with my websites. It&#8217;s great to do even one thing on that list!

When it comes to my websites, I always get hung up when I (feel like I) have to update with a new theme. Foundation kind of alleviated that feeling. It&#8217;s a super intuitive framework and easier (in my opinion) to work with than Bootstrap. Some time ago I accepted that I&#8217;m not really that much of a web designer. So now I opt for more simple designs. Even though I&#8217;ve been making websites for a couple of years now, I haven&#8217;t really improved much when it comes to web design. I just really want to focus on making original content instead of agonizing over how to display that content. Premade themes are more accesible but I feel obligated to make it myself. If it means taking the &#8220;easier&#8221; route by using frameworks, so be it.

I have to admit, most of the content I want to make is very &#8220;me&#8221; oriented. I mostly only care about archiving the things I do so that I can look back on them. Honestly, it doesn&#8217;t matter that much to me if I have a regular audience. While I genuinely like getting to know people who interact with my content, but it&#8217;s not the main goal. &#8220;Regular&#8221; social media, though, is another beast entirely.

Social media is known for instant gratification and love how fast and simple feedback is. Most of the time, the feedback I get isn&#8217;t even for my own content. There&#8217;s something so easy about social media and I can put in a lot of time into it. I&#8217;ve been trying to cut down but recently I logged back into my Tumblr account. However, I unfollowed a lot of fandom blogs and now I follow study related blogs. It gets old quickly when I&#8217;m scrolling through similar posts (unfortunately, a lot of study posts look the same) so I have been opening the Tumblr app less. In a weird way, I&#8217;m also more motivated to post my own original content there. I even automatically post my content from my study blog over here.

Now I totally forgot how I ended this post. I originally wanted this post to be a sort of summer wrap up but I kinda went off on a tangent. One of the habits that I need to work on is to stop talking about 138741287 things in one blog post. I&#8217;m not really good at the blogging thing but I do it anyway. Like I said, I&#8217;ll work on it.
