I&#8217;m in a weird place where I&#8217;m reading a lot but I&#8217;m unsure if I&#8217;m feeling depressed because I&#8217;m reading too much or I&#8217;m reading too much because I&#8217;m feeling depressed.

I&#8217;ve always thought of books as an escape. That sounds a little too negative but I enjoy experiencing a story that I would probably never experience myself. Lately I&#8217;ve gravitated to historical fiction because it&#8217;s just so different and unknown territory. But sometimes when I finish a book, I feel a little bit sad. Sometimes, I envy the characters for their exciting lives and feel worse about my own life.

At the same time, I read because my own life is boring. I&#8217;m not sure how to feel.
