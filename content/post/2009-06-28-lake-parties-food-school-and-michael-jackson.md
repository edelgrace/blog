Some updates&#8230; Alright, I&#8217;ve got the basic Nav links up. Sadly, I forgot the Affies and Linkage&#8230; links. TT_TT I&#8217;ll fix it later (read the last paragraph). I got my Twitter up, my stats counter, and a new C-BOX! What am I missing? Oh right, actual content! Don&#8217;t worry, I&#8217;m working on it&#8230;

Now back to real life&#8230; Yesterday I went to a party for the end of the year. Okay, it was more like a BBQ but it still counts, right? We ate hot dogs, and chips. They rented sumo wrestling suits, and everyone wrestled each other. It was quite amusing.

Then, today I went to ANOTHER party. It was at the lake. I couldn&#8217;t swim (I CAN swim&#8230;but I couldn&#8217;t&#8230;), so I played volleyball instead. Yeah&#8230;I epically failed. It was fun either way.

Tomorrow&#8217;s the last day off school. ANOTHER barbeque, and report cards. Watch me fail my exams. Haha&#8230; And since I can not buy games with my iTunes gift card (stupid Canadian laws!), I resort to buying Michael Jackson songs with a rip offf price off $1.29!

Anyway~ I&#8217;ve been watching Tatsuya Ueda fanvids! They&#8217;re really cute. I need to make one&#8230;one day. Haha. Those who don&#8217;t know me, I am a total Tatsuya Ueda fanatic. He&#8217;s a Japanese singer from the group KAT-TUN. So cute, lovely singer, and amazing song writer! I have no chance with him, but a girl can dream!

Eh. My mom wants me to go to sleep now. It&#8217;s only 8:15! And who cares if you&#8217;re late tomorrow. They don&#8217;t take attendance&#8230; Well, I&#8217;m going now! Good night (how is it night time?)! Love ya!
