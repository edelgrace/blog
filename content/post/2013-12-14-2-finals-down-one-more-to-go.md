I&#8217;m done all the finals that I&#8217;m mostly concerned about. Ok, I&#8217;m also concerned about CPSC 231 but not as much as I was about the other two. The main reason why I&#8217;m concerned about it? I don&#8217;t want to let senpai down. Lame, I know. Super lame. But I don&#8217;t want to look like an idiot in front of him! It&#8217;s a super easy course and if I screw it up, it&#8217;s super embarrassing!

I also got a haircut that I didn&#8217;t really like and I don&#8217;t want to face senpaiiiiii. I guess I&#8217;ll tie it up or something.

Senpai no. :( I don&#8217;t want you to notice me!
