Okay I admittedly watch too many videos on YouTube when I should be doing school things but I really like looking for videos of U-KISS. I find it to be so embarrassing that I am a fan. I have to watch metal<sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_1-210" id="back_ajs-fn-id_1-210">1</a></sup> music videos afterwards to <strike>regain my manliness</strike> get rid of that sickly sweet aftertaste in my mouth that I get when I look, hear, or even think about at U-KISS. If you don&#8217;t know who U-KISS are, keep it that way and bless your innocent soul.

If (god forbid) you want to know who they are anyway, U-KISS is a Korean boy group. If you still don&#8217;t understand, they&#8217;re kinda like (and I cringe when I say this) One Direction. They&#8217;re essentially really cute boys who dance and sing and some times rap. Now, I&#8217;m mostly not ashamed to admit that I like Korean pop but the only boy group I really listen to is Big Bang. They&#8217;re bad ass. U-KISS? They&#8217;re all bubblegum and fairies. That&#8217;s the main reason why I&#8217;m so embarrassed to be a Kiss Me<sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_2-210" id="back_ajs-fn-id_2-210">2</a></sup>. Fairies and stuff. :(

But seriously though. U-KISS.

**EDIT:**

But actually, screw U-KISS right now because I just discovered (or rediscovered) some beautiful bands.
