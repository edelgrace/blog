My New Year&#8217;s resolutions aren&#8217;t going so well. I&#8217;m pretty sure I&#8217;ve broken at least half of them already! But that doesn&#8217;t mean I&#8217;m giving up on them. I&#8217;m starting fresh this week, and I will get stuff done.

This week is going to be tough. I have two midterms on subjects that I have absolutely no idea on what&#8217;s going on. I didn&#8217;t study as much as I wanted to on the weekend. I went to a 3 hour review session which helped a little bit and doing some homework assignments served as a nice review but still not enough.

Last night I had a weird existential mini-crisis. You know, the whole &#8220;omg what am I doing with my life I&#8217;m going to turn out to be a crazy old cat lady living in my parent&#8217;s basement, that is, if I don&#8217;t kill myself first&#8221; spiel. I spent an hour crying and dwelling on my feelings and I felt extremely better afterwards. The downside was that I spent an hour on this whereas I should have spent an hour doing my homework. So it&#8217;s like 11:45 at night, my assignment&#8217;s due in 14 minutes, and I still had two questions left to do. A Linkin Park song comes to mind. &#8220;I tried so hard, and I got so far. But in the end, it didn&#8217;t even matter.&#8221; Yeah I got through halfway of one of the questions and ran out of time. Let&#8217;s just say that I took home a 39% with me that night.

So I&#8217;m taking this blog post to repeat my <del>vows, I mean,</del> resolutions that I need to work on.

## 1. Post more

The beginning on January was nice. I posted a lot then. Not so much for the rest of January.

## 3. Spend only an hour per week on Tumblr

I defs broke this resolution this weekend. But I&#8217;m giving up Tumblr for Lent (which starts this Wednesday) so it&#8217;ll get better, and fast! I just need to queue about 60 more posts and I&#8217;m good for the next 40+ days.

## 5. Don&#8217;t skip any lectures

I skipped one lecture. I&#8217;m a horrible person, I know. We had a guest lecturer (who just happened to be the Dean) and apparently it wasn&#8217;t that helpful anyway for one of my classmates slept through it.

## 6. Stop doing assignments the day before

Why do all of my assignments have to be due on Sunday and/or Monday?? I leave everything to the weekend because I&#8217;m too busy doing nothing during the week.

## 12. 3.0 GPA for this semester

This isn&#8217;t happening. I&#8217;ve failed a couple of quizzes here and there. But I&#8217;ll try to get as high as I can.

EDIT: I just realized that my assignment is actually due tonight, not yesterday night. What a relief!
