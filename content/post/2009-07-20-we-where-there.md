**Some Updates:**

  1. I&#8217;m working on a shrine for Green Day. The first project! Whoot!
  2. I&#8217;m almost done the icons for the MJ tribute! But I still have a lot to do&#8230;
  3. Me and my friends are making a movie. I just might post it here.
  4. I&#8217;m making a new layout! This Ueda layout is a bit boring, haha.

**Real Life:**

&#8220;We Where There&#8221; by Yuki Obata is definitely THE love story. I can&#8217;t explain it well, so just check it for youselves on OneManga.com or You Tube. But I warn you. If you aren&#8217;t in a good mood, reading/watching this will just make it worse. So much&#8230;angst!

Anyway. I&#8217;m waiting for the custody hearing for Jackson&#8217;s kids. It&#8217;s today, right? Argh! I&#8217;m really anxious. Paris and the kids deserve the best.

Well, I&#8217;m going to go film now. Bye bye~
