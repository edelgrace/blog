So yeah I&#8217;m kinda confused. The guy I like, I hang out with him a lot and stuff. We&#8217;re constantly asked if we&#8217;re dating. So on Wednesday he puts his arm around me and we&#8217;re asked it again and he says, &#8220;Not officially&#8230;&#8221; I&#8217;m like what? Cause I&#8217;ve never heard anything about that.

And a couple of weeks before that I gave him his birthday present (he&#8217;s 18 now. His birthday two days after mine.) He came home all happy and his mom got all angry and told him he couldn&#8217;t get involved with me since he&#8217;s an adult and I&#8217;m a minor. Sheesh. Parents.

So as I type on my iPod, I&#8217;m chatting with him. He hasn&#8217;t said anything since then. About dating. I sure wish he did. Ughh. Anyway, I have finals to study for. See you~!
