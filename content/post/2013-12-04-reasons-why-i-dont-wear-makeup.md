  * I&#8217;m lazy.
  * It&#8217;s expensive.
  * Out of the three times I&#8217;ve worn makeup in my life, I felt more self conscious with makeup than without.
  * I feel like a clown.
  * It physically feels weird on my face.
  * If y&#8217;all don&#8217;t love me without the makeup but love me with it, I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;d want to wear it in the first place.
