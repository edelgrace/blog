Lent is finally over. :) My journey with no interent was&#8230; Not very successful but I managed to go by with minimal (emphasis on minimal) internet. I mostly dedicated myself to YouTube on the &#8220;play all&#8221; function so that was interesting. It&#8217;s weird because I had the strongest urge to blog throughout the forty days. Very odd, I thought I would just forget about it but it wasn&#8217;t the case at all. I actually started writing blog posts that I intended to post for later.

So what&#8217;s new with my life? Absolutely nothing. I&#8217;m really getting my butt kicked in everything schoool related. Not literally. But that&#8217;s not new, I&#8217;m always getting my butt kicked! I just need to pick up the pace and spring break seems like the greatest oppurtunity to catch up and get on my study horse again.

Here&#8217;s my little to-do list for the break:

1. Study for a calculus test.
  
2. Trig review questions.
  
3. Physics homework from last week.
  
4. Activity guide on democracy.
  
5. 130+ questions on _Wuthering Heights_.
  
6. Start and finish reading _Heart of Darkness_.
  
7. Start reading _Kafka on the Shore_.

Yeah. I think there&#8217;s more actually but the most daunting task is those questions on _Wuthering Heights_. I&#8217;m currently avoiding it but sooner or later I have to do it. I guess looking at that list is motivation in itself. Also, I want to get this done and over with so I have the rest of the break to do whatever I want (sitting at the computer, watching TV, playing video games, and more, haha) instead of doing everything I want first and then staying up until 3 in the morning the day before I go back to school.

On another note, today is my mother&#8217;s birthday today! She&#8217;s 53 today. It&#8217;s interesting how we (we as in teenagers, which I know doesn&#8217;t apply to all of you out there) get so caught up in our own lives and our growing up but we don&#8217;t really notice our parent(s)/guardian(s) growing older. Suddenly I notice the wrinkles, the knobby hands, the slightly bent back, and the strands of grey hair. Needless to say, I&#8217;m starting to appreciate my mom a whole lot more. Happy birthday mom!
