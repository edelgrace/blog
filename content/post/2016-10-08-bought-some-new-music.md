Lately I&#8217;ve been using Spotify a lot. I only ever use it when I&#8217;m at my computer. When I&#8217;m on the go, I turn to my trusty iPod classic. Since I use the free version of Spotify (now that I have a job, I can&#8217;t say that I&#8217;m a broke college student anymore but I can say that I&#8217;m still cheap), being able to choose what I listen to is a must and Spotify mobile doesn&#8217;t have that ability. The contrast between the songs on my iPod and Spotify is staggering.

On my iPod, I have a bunch of foreign artists, mainly Japanese and Korean with a side of Taiwanese. If you look at my Spotify, it&#8217;s mostly a bunch of really poppy Western mainstream music. I&#8217;ve discovered a lot of new artists through Spotify simply because the Japanese catalogues on Spotify is sparse and I value accurate tagging (English translations of song titles vs. the original Japanese characters on the back of a CD) too much to listen to some of the Japanese music that is on Spotify.

So it&#8217;s always a treat when I happen to get my hands on an iTunes gift card (remember, I said I&#8217;m cheap). Except it&#8217;s also hard trying to figure out what I want to buy with it because I can only choose the best. I only managed to squeeze out 9 songs from my $10 gift card but it&#8217;s like 35 minutes worth of music so $0.28 cents per minute? I actually have no idea if that&#8217;s a good amount or not.

On to what I bought!

  * **E is For Estranged by Owen Pallett**
  
    I didn&#8217;t discover Owen Pallett from Spotify (my ex introduced me to him) but I did discover this song on Spotify! Even though the storyline of the song doesn&#8217;t relate to me at all, I associate this song with myself as my name starts with E. There&#8217;s something incredibly nostalgic about this song with a dash of good old melancholy.
  * **Icarus, Bint Elkhandaq, and Maghawir by Mashrou&#8217; Leila**
  
    When I used to be obsessed with TCGs, I was inspired for a couple of months to make a TCG of my own: an Asian music inspired TCG. Except I was determined to include Asian countries that weren&#8217;t just Japan, Korea, China, and Taiwan. On my search, I came across Lebanese based alternative band Mashrou&#8217; Leila. They were more secular than I expected with songs covering topics such as homosexuality, clubbing, and politics but I mostly fell in love with their catchy tunes! Their latest album (which all three of these song are from) is a bit more on the poppy side but I honestly love the entire album so just picking a few songs to buy was difficult.
  * **Let Me Go! feat. Sophie Hunger by Erik Truffaz 4tet**
  
    I stumbled onto this song purely by chance, thanks to Mashrou&#8217; Leila. The lead singer of Mashrou&#8217; Leila performed a cover of this song from Erik Truffaz 4tet. I was enchanted by it and hurried to listen to the original. Hearing it being sung in English hit me hard. Sophie Hunger has a perfect voice for this song. It has a sense of longing to break free that she captures perfectly.
  * **Paris is Burning and All My Stars Aligned by St. Vincent**
  
    I had heard of St. Vincent before but wasn&#8217;t entirely sure what she was about. I _think_ she came up on my Discover Weekly on Spotify one day and and according to my Last.fm, it was most likely **Paris is Burning**. The song was unbelievably quirky and I fell in love instantly. It took me a couple of months to listen to the rest of the **Marry Me** album and **All My Stars Aligned** was one of the songs that resonated with me. It was an obvious jab at people who turn to superstitions (astrology, palm reading, etc.) which I sometimes dabble in but I loved it so much. Also St. Vincent is an absolutely beautiful human being.
  * **Human Sadness by Julian Casablancas + The Voidz**
  
    This song I know for sure came up on my Discover Weekly on Spotify. I had been listening to some of Julian&#8217;s tracks from his solo album **Phrazes for the Young** for a bit up to that point. When I heard **Human Sadness**, it hit all the right buttons with me and I knew I had to know more about this Julian dude. Long 10 minute epic? Check. Grungy lo-fi vibe? Check. Cool guitar riffs? Check. Depressing song title? Check. Depressing song lyrics? Check. Although once I learned the lyrics, some of the impact the song had on me was a little reduced but there are some gems. &#8220;The moon&#8217;s a skull, I think it&#8217;s grinning&#8221; is one of them.
  * **You Only live Once by The Strokes**
  
    The original YOLO. Okay, when I found out Julian Casablancas was the lead singer of The Strokes, my mind was blown. I immediately dived in head first into their music after finding this out. Okay, I&#8217;m still on their first album and last EP but there is a lot to digest. <del>I&#8217;m not going to lie, part of the reason why I love this song is because Julian is so damn beautiful in the music video.</del> Something about this song makes me want to get up and dance, strangely enough. I also can&#8217;t resist singing along to this song. It&#8217;s so British rock that I would have totally thought they were British if I didn&#8217;t know any better.

Songs that I totally want to buy next time:

  * **Cool by Gwen Stefani**
  
    I went through a really weird and brief Gwen Stefani phase earlier in the year. I don&#8217;t know how it came about. I remember seeing this music video on Much Music and dismissing it as Gwen acting all sexy in a luxurious mansion but now what I get from it is that Gwen is gorgeous is a brunette. Okay, I did get more out of it. It&#8217;s actually quite a mature song when I think about it. It takes a lot to look back at a past relationship (that first love you thought that you would marry, at that) and fully accept that you&#8217;ve both moved on while still being close friends. I&#8217;m a bit of a romantic in that way, I guess.
  * **Cruel by St. Vincent**
  
    My love for this woman is neverending. The guitar solo isn&#8217;t long at all but it&#8217;s the highlight of the song, in my opinion. I love how St. Vincent tackles the subject of the unappreciated parental figure. Also, props to St. Vincent for using gender neutral language (she refers to this unappreciated person as &#8220;bodies&#8221; throughout the song).
  * **Galaxy by LADIES&#8217; CODE**
  
    This song is sexy. I can&#8217;t say more about it, unfortunately, haha! This is a Korean girl group which I found on Spotify, which is a little rare for me. I like this song a lot.
  * **Utada Hikaru&#8217;s new album!!!!!!!**
  
    I was tempted to spend all $10 on this album but I decided against it as the songs I&#8217;ve listened to on the album I already own. I want a more concrete opinion of the album before I buy it. The teaser for the Shiina Ringo collaboration was so tempting. But I like making informed buying decisions. I know I won&#8217;t be disappointed since it&#8217;s Utada Hikaru, but still.
  * **Unrequited Love by CAPSULE**
  
    While on my latest trip to the Philippines, I listened to _WAVE_ _RUNNER_ multiple times on the plane there. A lot of people complain about how Western the album is. EDM and dubstep is horrible. Toshiko doesn&#8217;t sing much. Blah, blah, blah&#8230; I personally found the album to be pretty good. Honestly, I dismiss comments that complain of foreign music being &#8220;too Western.&#8221; In my mind it implies a weird exoticizing take on foreign music. Anyway, I really like this song, despite not being heavy into electronic music. Toshiko has great lines.
  * **House of Balloons/Glass Table Girls by The Weekend**
  
    The earlier works of The Weekend are intoxicating. Seriously, The Weekend&#8217;s super clean vocals mixed with the heavy beats make for songs that make you feel like you&#8217;re on a trip (is that how the kids say it nowadays). This song is just intoxicating in a seductive way.
  * **Primadonna by Marina and the Diamonds**
  
    Marina is HOT. Her Electra Heart era reawakened my hidden feelings for Vanessa Hudgens (you can&#8217;t deny that Marina looks at least a little like Vanessa!). But yeah, there&#8217;s something really attractive about her Electra Heart persona. It&#8217;s a shame that she doesn&#8217;t view the era as a great period in her career because I love it. Primadonna is like a rich spoiled girl anthem and I can&#8217;t get enough of it.
  * **Divers by Joanna Newsome**
  
    &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;. I can&#8217;t believe I forgot about this song. Unfortunately, Joanna doesn&#8217;t have her music on Spotify so unless I&#8217;m on YouTube, I don&#8217;t listen to this song. Which is a great reason why I need this song! I think I&#8217;ve written about _Divers_ before but I will reiterate once again that I am IN LOVE with Joanna. She&#8217;s extremely polarizing. You either kiss the earth she walks on or think her voice is like nails on chalkboard. This is a masterpiece and I love her. I totally regret not buying this now. Damn, how could I forget this song?
