I meant to post last on the 15th but I just couldn&#8217;t. I didn&#8217;t feel like I should blog. It just didn&#8217;t feel right to do so. Even now, I&#8217;m not so comfortable posting this but I just need to get it out, which is why it&#8217;s private. Only three people have the password to my private posts so I guess it&#8217;s not that bad.

On the 15th I received a text from a friend asking about our mutual friend, T.

T&#8217;s one of my closest guy friends whom I affectionly call Muffin. We went to the same junior high together and we both excelled at the extreme sport of procrastination. I told Muffin everything about life. I trusted him with all my secrets. However, within the past year I haven&#8217;t really talked to him that much. We&#8217;d see each other in the halls and say a quick &#8220;Hi how are you?&#8221; and go on to our classes. Sometimes there was a hug. Him ruffling my hair. Poking each others sides. The usual friendship shenanigans.

So my friend asked if I had talked to Muffin lately and to check his Facebook page. I said no and proceeded to look at his wall on Facebook. There was a single post that I saw right away. It was a RIP message from his sister. At first I couldn&#8217;t really believe it. &#8220;Oh it&#8217;s a practical joke or something.&#8221; But as people started commenting and more wall posts began to appear, I realized that it wasn&#8217;t a joke. Somehow, I had a small shred of hope that maybe, just maybe, it was a joke after all.

Still, I couldn&#8217;t sleep right away that night. I cried and prayed that this wasn&#8217;t real. When I walked into the band room for practice this morning, I felt like throwing up. His sister, M, is in band and plays the flute, just like me. She&#8217;s the sweetest girl I know and she&#8217;s always smiling. So when I saw her crying, I was filled with dread. It wasn&#8217;t a joke. T&#8217;s really gone.

Me and my friend A didn&#8217;t say anything but we went over and hugged her. I tried to keep myself from crying because it would just be selfish of me. It was so hard, especially when M started shaking in my arms as she sobbed. The only thought in my head was, &#8220;T, why did you leave her behind, this sweet little girl who just loves you to death? What happened to make you leave?&#8221;

At that point, I didn&#8217;t really know what happened exactly but I had a vague feeling. I still don&#8217;t like to say it because it just makes me shiver all over.

First period comes and goes and then it&#8217;s time for second period. While my teacher was explaining every single meaning of every single sentence and word and punctuation mark of _Heart of Darkness_, another teacher walks in and gives her a sheet of paper. A troubled looked crossed over my teacher&#8217;s face and she sighed. I clenched my jaw and buried my head into my book.

Half an hour passes and my principal&#8217;s voice comes onto the intercom, &#8220;Please excuse this interruption. Teachers please read out the handout you just received. Thank you.&#8221;

&#8220;We learned that over the weekend that T.W. passed away&#8230;&#8221;

I ground my teeth so that my mouth wouldn&#8217;t wobble or let out a cry. It was official. Really official this time. I spent the rest of the period trying not to cry. I couldn&#8217;t believe that Muffin was gone.

After that the week went well actually. I tried not to think about it during the day, and it worked. I said my prayers for him every night.

Friday was the funeral.

I&#8217;ve never been to a funeral so I was scared. I was bit late but I managed to see two of my friends who I stood next to the whole time. It was crowded. I kind of expected it. Muffin has a lot friends. He was just so outgoing and cheerful and kind that all kinds of people flocked to him. So we literally stood a few inches away from the entrance where tons of over people where standing as well for the whole time.

Muffin&#8217;s friend, appropriately nicknamed Cupcake, made a speech. It was wonderful. So many memories flooded into my mind at the time. I giggled at some of the hilarious teenage shenanigans and cried at the parts when it seemed like Cupcake couldn&#8217;t hold it together. But he did and I never felt so proud for him. This is cheesy, but I was filled with love for some reason.

As it came to a close, I had a sudden urge to see his face. One last time. But I was in the back and I couldn&#8217;t make it to see him in time. Maybe it was better if I didn&#8217;t. I probably wouldn&#8217;t have handled it.

When they brought out the coffin, all the emotions I held in that past week burst out of me. I sobbed into my friend&#8217;s shoulder as I watched as his best friend since the age of seven carried the coffin into the hearse. As I watched as his father quietly sobbed in his arm as the other men held him. As I saw his sister turn her head away and cry out loud. I couldn&#8217;t believe it. Was that really Muffin in that coffin? What was his expression? And as silly as this sounds, was it really him? I was filled with immense sorrow and anger at that moment. Anger at myself, anger at him, anger towards whatever had caused this&#8230; I still kind of am but now it&#8217;s considerably less.

After the hearse drove away, I made me way to say my condolences. All I could say was &#8220;I haven&#8217;t seen you in a while&#8221; and I hugged Cupcake for the longest time. I suddenly realized how long it was since I talked to him and how long it was since I told anyone any of my secrets. Then I went to hug Muffin&#8217;s sister. It was a quick one. I don&#8217;t know her that well. She looked at me and with the bravest and strongest face I have ever seen she said, &#8220;If you want anything of Tai&#8217;s, let me know.&#8221; That&#8217;s another topic entirely.

I lingered around. Hugged. Cried. Said good byes. I left feeling better.

I&#8217;m still a bit unsettled. The halls seem emptier. I miss him. But little by little, I&#8217;m getting used to it. I&#8217;m not sure about his family though, especially his sister. They must have it so hard. I can&#8217;t even begin to imagine it. For now, I&#8217;m going to pray for him and his family. I hope he can hear my prayers.
