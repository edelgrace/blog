Right now I&#8217;m working on a layout that features someone&#8230; I know it&#8217;s Ryo, but a Ryo from what band? I don&#8217;t know anymore! I forgot! It&#8217;s not the Ryo from Maximum The Hormone or Ryo from JE. My friend told me a list of Japanese guys she thought was hot, and I went to find desktop backgrounds for her. Ryo was on the list&#8230; Uwah! My memory is bad.

I&#8217;m supposed to go to a party soon, but it&#8217;s mostly for his dad to get drunk with his buddies. The kids that do go there are mostly younger than me, so it&#8217;s kinda boring&#8230; But my cutie pie baby cousin is going :3

Speaking of cousins, I miss my cousins back in the Philippines! Especially Kuya Melchor TT_TT (I&#8217;ll explain later maybe&#8230;). I miss the sun~! It&#8217;s getting colder and colder here. Stupid Albertan weather!

And last but not least, let&#8217;s have a late welcome to a new affiliate: [simple graphic lyts.][1]{.external} run by the lovely Keisha!
