Today is the last day of school for winter break! Yay! We were supposed to have pizza but it never came&#8230; We also watched a movie that I have watched too many times: _The Polar Express_. Then my camera ran out of batteries after I just took one picture of my friends. It wasn&#8217;t a great day, but I&#8217;m glad it&#8217;s just over.
