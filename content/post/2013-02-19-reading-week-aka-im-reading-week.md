I went to the library last Saturday! Quite fitting because it is reading week at university. I&#8217;m probably the only one who takes the &#8220;reading&#8221; in reading week seriously&#8230; Anyway, here is my library haul this week in order of the books I remember first:

  * French Milk by Lucy Knisley  
    I&#8217;m always a sucker for personal memoir-like graphic novels. The cover is just too charming to not want to read it!
  * Negima! (Volume 1) by Ken Akamatsu  
    The name sounded familiar so I though, why not? I picked it up. Turns out Akamatsu is the mangaka for _Love Hina_. I predict boobs.
  * Pure by Timothy Mo  
    Not going to lie, the cover is what did it for me. So pure.
  * I Shall Not Hate by Dr. Izzeldin Abuelaish&#8217;s  
    Apparently this has been on my to read list for a while. I don&#8217;t know how or why but it&#8217;s been on there! So I finally decided to get it.
  * The Last Unicorn by Peter S. Beagle  
    I&#8217;ve been looking for a book I once read in elementary. This is a possible candidate for said book.
  * The Selector of Souls by Shauna Singh Baldwin  
    My library was doing a blind date with a book thing. I thought it would be about tapestries. It&#8217;s actually about India. Close enough.
  * Daughter of Xanadu by Dori Jones Yang  
    Another one that&#8217;s been on my to read list for a while.

Books that I still need to add to the log:

  * Moon Boy (Volume 4)
  * Moon Boy (Volume 5)
  * Josephine: A Life of the Empress
  * The Case for God
  * A whole load more of books&#8230;

I recently got back into reading online web comics&#8230; That was definitely not a good idea&#8230;
