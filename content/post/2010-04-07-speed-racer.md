**Listening to:** Tada, Hitotsu no Koi &#8211; Koizora OST

So I&#8217;ve been obssessed with _Koizora_ lately. The movie, drama, manga, novel, AND the soundtrack. Oh jeez. No matter what form of media it&#8217;s in, it never ceases to make bawl my eyes out. Plus, in the drama, Seto Koji is pretty hot. \*cough\*

Today was pretty good. I went to the mall and caused some shenanigans. I bought a visa gift card and I&#8217;m going to use it to buy iPod toch apps. Square Enix games FTW.

So, something even more amazing, is _Joanna Newsom_. I love her now. No joke. She&#8217;s like Bj√∂rk but not as amazing. Never did I ever think I would like folk music. Her voice is so child like and her harp playing is mesmerizing. The poetry in the lyrics is a breath of fresh air. Nothing like mainstream pop. Mmm. :3

Since it&#8217;s 1:06 AM and I feel like passing out, I&#8217;m going to sleep. Goodnight interwebz!
