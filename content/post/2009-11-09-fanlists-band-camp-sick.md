I&#8217;m thinking of changing all my fanlist links and moving them from Ueda Hime to over here. Would that be a good idea? I&#8217;m debating if I have enough time to do it in one session&#8230; probably not. I might do it eventually though&#8230;

I&#8217;m sick. -.- AND I MISSED BAND CAMP! Ahhh! Oh well. My friends sent me pics from their phones and one even took the time to text me any moment he could (that was Tanner <3). So yeah, my friends are amazing and I love them! I missed two days of school so yeah, HOMEWORK! Whoot! Not.

Oh oh and there is a layout in the works! I&#8217;m trying to re-learn DIV layers cause apparently I learned them the wrong way (haha&#8230;).

Some Tanner texts:

&#8220;Awe I&#8217;m gunna miss you so much&#8221;
  
&#8220;I am going to miss you sooooooo much&#8221;
  
&#8220;I wont get a hug from you for days :( tear&#8221;
  
&#8220;TA was dull without you&#8221;
  
&#8220;U r missing out&#8221;
  
&#8220;No you sleep! I will talk to you later&#8221;

:3 He makes me feel warm and fuzzy inside. Haha.

Well I have to write a speech. Bye~! <3
