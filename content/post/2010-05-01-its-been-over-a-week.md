So it&#8217;s been about 9 days since he broke up with me.
  
We haven&#8217;t talked at all.
  
Ocassionally we meet eyes and turn away&#8230;
  
We walk past each other without saying a word.
  
I walk to lunch by myself now.
  
He sits at the other side of the band room.
  
On Wednesday, he was playing Outsider and other music which I loved.
  
It&#8217;s almost like he&#8217;s luring me with music again&#8230;
  
They say he misses me.
  
If he misses me, then why did he break it off?
