I can hear again! I went into the walk-in clinic and they shot hot water in my ear. It felt like those jet hot tubs&#8230;except in your ear. Haha. It kinda hurt but the main thing is, I CAN HEAR!

Anyway my best friend is in the US and I miss her! She&#8217;s missing out all the fun youth events at church. Like tomorrow is the Corn Maze! Yes, Corn Mazes! I&#8217;ve never been in a maze before but it sounds fun! I hope it doesn&#8217;t rain so I can go!

I&#8217;m working on my MJ tribute! I have so much to do! I&#8217;m having fun with it anyway. I&#8217;m going to go actually work on it now! See ya!
