While I can&#8217;t say I&#8217;m a huge gamer, I game enough to be excited about E3 that&#8217;s starting tomorrow. There is a ton of stuff that are coming out that will hopefully be super crazy due to the next gen consoles that are coming this year. So, here&#8217;s what I&#8217;ll be keeping my eyes glued to the screen on over the next few days.

### PS4 Console

They showed us the controller, they showed us the features, and they showed us the games. They haven&#8217;t showed us the actual console. Contrary to the Xbox One reveal, the reveal for the PS4 was basically advertising for games. While I do think that not showing the console may give them some leverage over Microsoft in that they might be able to make some last minute tweaks, it&#8217;s probably not significant if they showed it before or after the Xbox One. Still doesn&#8217;t change the fact that I&#8217;m super excited to see it!

### Used Game, Rental, and Trading Policies

Used games are awesome. When my cousin gives me games he thought he&#8217;d like but didn&#8217;t, it&#8217;s even better. Mostly because overpriced games hurt my wallet. And because my family is always super late to an next gen consoles. For example, we bought a PS3 **just last year**. It&#8217;ll be a couple of years until we get the PS4 and I&#8217;m hoping a lot of used games will be available for us (the cheaper they are, the better).

### WATCH_DOGS

I hate to say that I love Ubisoft, but I love Ubisoft. Despite their endless pitfalls, they make games that I like. Watching the WATCH_DOGS segment at the PS4 reveal was mind blowing. I was hooked at the very second it started. I&#8217;m a sucker for conspiracy theories, especial the &#8220;one company that controls about 90% of the world but no one really knows it&#8221; kind of conspiracies. The game itself looks awesome. It&#8217;s reminiscent of Assassin&#8217;s Creed and my fingers are crossed that maybe it might take place on the Assassin&#8217;s Creed universe (which is not likely, since I&#8217;m pretty sure UbiGabe shot that idea down).

### Destiny

I&#8217;ve never gotten into Halo and probably never will but with this new IP, I might finally get a taste of the next and possibly biggest series to date. But before that happens, I need to see what it&#8217;s all about and if it&#8217;ll be a series at all.

### Gameplay

Cinematic trailers and speeches are all fine and dandy but gameplay is where it&#8217;s at. Gameplay is the deal breaker. It comes before everything else. I personally haven&#8217;t seen a lot of gameplay from any of the upcoming games so I look forward to it!
