I let Pure-Orenji.info go because of money issues. This is not the case here. I don&#8217;t think anyone (except for maybe one or two people) followed Pure Orenji back when it was a blog. During that time I was going through a weird relationship thing. Also around that time I bought Brokenphrases.info. The name &#8220;Brokenphrases&#8221; was highly inspired by my (lack of) social skills and as much as I don&#8217;t like to admit it, a poem written by the other person in said relationship.

It&#8217;s been almost three years since I&#8217;ve spoken to that person and we left on bitter terms. I should have gotten rid of Brokenphrases right there but I didn&#8217;t because I was still clinging onto my feelings for that person. Even though it&#8217;s been such a long time ago and I don&#8217;t feel any bitterness anymore (more like awkwardness), I sometimes feel weird having Brokenphrases as a domain. It&#8217;s pretty much like regularly wearing a shirt that someone you once hated gave you. It&#8217;s weird.

I&#8217;m still on the fence about it. If I were to let this site go, I&#8217;d buy another domain name or merge it with another one of my websites. Any thoughts?
