I was browsing through some blogs yesterday and came across a blog dedicated to a cat. The blog, [I Am Maru][1]{.external} is ridiculously cute. It&#8217;s about a cat named Maru who lives in Japan. The owner likes to take pictures of Maru and put cute captions underneath it. I really think it&#8217;s adorable.

I love cats. They&#8217;re just so fluffy and moody (for some reason, that&#8217;s what I love about them). Sadly, I&#8217;m 99% sure I&#8217;m allergic to cats. My eyes get red, puffy, and watery whenever I&#8217;m around cats. I also sneeze like a maniac. It&#8217;s unfortunate because I&#8217;ve always loved cats. Maybe one day I could get a hairless or hypoallergenic cat. Like a sphynx or something. Although, anything that&#8217;s hairless kinda freaks me out. Remember Kim Possible? I looked at a real picture of a real naked mole rat because of it. After that, I was never the same again. Sphynx cats kinda looks cute though.

Anyway, I start school in nine days. I&#8217;m excited but a bit scared. My last year of high school! Then I&#8217;ll be somewhat pushed into the real world.

I took some of your suggestions and started looking at scholarships and such. There&#8217;s a lot of them. I found this one scholarship that give $3,000 for every year for three years if you&#8217;re studying on the oil and gas industry, which is exactly what I&#8217;m planning on doing. That would be **a lot** of help. So I&#8217;m going to have to work even harder this year. My schedule is packed and I anticipate a whole load of work. Yeah, I&#8217;m gonna relax as much as I can over the next nine days.
