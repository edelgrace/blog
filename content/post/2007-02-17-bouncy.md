Hello! I haven&#8217;t posted in a while. For some reason I&#8217;ve been on [Geek Stink breath][1]{.external} a lot. I miss the old GSB, when there were more people there. I still love GSB though!

I have been working on my religion project for the past four days. I&#8217;m finally finished now. Thank goodness. Who knew that a simple powerpoint about a saint would be so much work? I guess I&#8217;m too much of a perfectionist.

My mom keeps complaining on how I&#8217;m &#8220;losing weight&#8221;. I am not losing! If anything, I&#8217;m gaining weight. It feels like it to me, anyway. And no, I do not think I&#8217;m fat, I&#8217;m perfectly average!

I am so tired right now. I now I&#8217;m kind of bouncing from one topic to another, but whatever.

I haven&#8217;t posted story in a long time either. I&#8217;ve lost my passion for Rock Skool. Does that mean I have lost the passion for writing? No, I don&#8217;t think so. I&#8217;m still writing. More about anime fan fics than Green Day fan fics. 

I haven&#8217;t listened to Green Day in a long time. I&#8217;m not even sure I like them anymore. Maybe I&#8217;ll go watch _Bullet in a Bible_ tomorrow. Live performances always rekindle my love for a band, unless the band really sucks at live concerts, which is not the case for Green Day! 

Anyway, I have to go. See you later!
