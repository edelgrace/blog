      <h1 class="title">I Watched: Rogue One</h1>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p><strong>Spoilers, beware.</strong></p>

<p>I am not a huge <em>Star Wars</em> fan. I watched the first trilogy very quickly, bits and pieces of the second trilogy, and <em>The Force Awakens</em>. Honestly, most of what I know about <em>Star Wars</em> is from the Lego video games and <em>Family Guy</em>. However, my lack of knowledge of the franchise didn&#8217;t stop me from going to the theaters and watching the latest installment.</p>

<p>When I first watched the <em>Rogue One</em> trailer, I was left wanting for a little more. There were characters I haven&#8217;t seen before and it revealed little about the plot. I avoided any spoilers about the movie, somehow, so I truly was going into it with zero expectations. Overall, I enjoyed it.</p>

<p class="subhead">
  <strong>The IMAX Experience</strong>
</p>

<p>Because we missed the showing we originally planned to see and I had to get home at a certain time, I picked the next showing which was IMAX. It didn&#8217;t really click with me that it was IMAX until it was five minutes before the movie started and I looked down at my ticket wondering why there wasn&#8217;t a theater number on it. Turns out, the theater number was &#8220;IMAX.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now, I don&#8217;t have an eye for special effects or resolution or whatever film buffs look for in terms of aesthetic quality. But right off the bat I realized that the movie was definitely not made to be 3D. There wasn&#8217;t a whole lot of depth and quite honestly, I forgot I was watching a supposedly 3D movie. In my opinion, skip the IMAX, you&#8217;re probably not missing much.</p>

<p class="subhead">
  <strong>The CGI</strong>
</p>

<p>Okay, I wasn&#8217;t completely spoiler free going into this movie. I had read somewhere on Reddit mentioning Princess Leia being recreated with CGI and not recasted. Thankfully I didn&#8217;t remember that comment until the scene where Leia appears. My first thought was, &#8220;Woah, that&#8217;s CGI?&#8221; I honestly think they did a great job.</p>

<p>It also wasn&#8217;t until I went on Reddit did I realize Tarkin was done in CGI as well. Not once did I get an uncanny valley vibe from that character. Now that I&#8217;m looking at screenshots after the fact, he does look significantly more cartoony. Still, it looks pretty impressive. Maybe my favourable opinion is due to the 3D masking some of the obvious CGI giveaways.</p>

<p class="subhead">
  <strong>The Story</strong>
</p>

<p>Like I said before, I had no idea what to expect going into the movie when it came to the plot. Since I&#8217;m not too familiar to the universe, it took me a while to grasp what exactly what was happening but I got the jist of it.</p>

<p>There were some cheesy moments, such as when Jyn goes to the Alliance with her father&#8217;s message and nothing comes out of it but wait, some people totally believe her and will go against their organization to help her! I get that it was necessary but it was a tad predictable.</p>

<p>The ending kinda left me in shock. When K-2 was killed my jaw hung open slightly. Then Donnie Yen died (I really don&#8217;t know the characters names very well) and I was getting a bit teary eyed. Then the big dude who follows Donnie Yen everywhere exploded. The deaths never stopped coming!</p>

<p>But what surprised me the most was the bittersweet ending. The mission is complete but many lives were sacrificed. One of the Rebel councillors implied that it would have been a suicide mission and it was. The last scene reminded me of the end of <em>2012</em>, of the two people holding onto each other in the incoming tidal wave. Honestly, it was a beautiful scene.</p>

<p class="subhead">
  <strong>The Characters</strong>
</p>

<p>K-2 was a very refreshing character and I enjoyed his comedic relief. And I think that&#8217;s the only character in the entire movie that made a lasting impression on me.</p>

<p>Throughout the entire movie I was trying to determine Cassian&#8217;s accent. French? Spanish? I still don&#8217;t know. Jyn was a little bit of a disappointment but I was thrilled at a female lead, even if Jyn felt extremelt flat. Donnie Yen&#8217;s character was pretty badass and I enjoyed his dynamic with his big sidekick. Tarkin was wonderfully creepy and fit the bill for a stereotypical villain but that&#8217;s all he was.</p>

<p>In short, nothing spectacular about the characters.</p>

<p class="subhead">
  <strong>The Summary</strong>
</p>

<p>It was a good movie. I don&#8217;t have much to complain about other than the flat characters that I felt little attachment to. Was it worth like $20 for the IMAX? Nope. But I think most people are pretty pleased with the movie and so am I.</p>
