<blockquote>
<p>You have been awakened.</p>

<p>Floppy disk inserted, computer turned on, a whirring, and then this sentence, followed by a blinking cursor. So begins Suspended, the first computer game to obsess seven-year-old Michael, to worm into his head and change his sense of reality. Thirty years later he will write: &#8220;Computer games have taught me the things you can&#8217;t learn from people.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gamelife is the memoir of a childhood transformed by technology. Afternoons spent gazing at pixelated maps and mazes train Michael&#8217;s eyes for the uncanny side of 1980s suburban Illinois. A game about pirates yields clues to the drama of cafeteria politics and locker-room hazing. And in the year of his parents&#8217; divorce, a spaceflight simulator opens a hole in reality.</p>

<p>In telling the story of his youth through seven computer games, Michael W. Clune captures the part of childhood we live alone.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#8217;m always intrigued about what people have to say about video games. What I find even more intriguing is how video games impact people&#8217;s lives. More often than not, most video game memoirs (that I have read) involve the awkward geek entering into the beginning of the video game era. They find themselves or find a way out of themselves with this exciting new piece of technology by playing their way through <em>Wolfenstein</em>, <em>Doom</em>, <em>Ultima</em>, <em>Super Mario Bros.</em>, etc., etc.</p>

<p>Michael Clune&#8217;s <em>Gamelife</em> is no exception to this template. What unique offerings he has are in the form of metaphors and a somewhat serious video game addiction. At times, it feels like Clune&#8217;s metaphors and observations are a bit of a stretch. It&#8217;s almost like he tries to find meaning in something that doesn&#8217;t have any meaning at all (i.e. <sky quote>). Other times, he&#8217;s awfully poetic.</p>

<p>There were points where I assumed the role of his mother. I, too, worried about Clune&#8217;s empty social life. But I also knew too well the unreasonably cruel ways that kids operated.</p>

<p>Okay, I didn&#8217;t really. I had a good group of friends that I grew up with. However, I never felt as inside of the group as I thought I should be. Like Michael, I saw my friends faces close off mid-laugh and their eyes suddenly go distant the moment I opened my mouth.</p>

<p>I, also like Michael, retreated into the world of video games but of the much milder sort. My addiction was Runescape and Club Penguin. I&#8217;d build endless camp fires, bake bread, and pretend to be a penguin spy. I wasn&#8217;t like Clune&#8217;s classmate Evan, who was true to himself no matter what character appeared on his screen. Even when I did name a character after myself, I always played as the person who I used to be.</p>

<p>It was observations like these, the ones where I found myself in them, that made me really appreciate this book. However there was something about Clune&#8217;s style of narration that didn&#8217;t jive with me. Perhaps, I disliked Clune&#8217;s portrayal of himself. There was no redemption moment for Clune and no real moments of growth.</p>

<p>Would I recommend this to someone? Yeah, I think it has value. The main reason why I didn&#8217;t enjoy this as much as I could have is probably a matter of preference.</p>
