          Hello, I&#8217;m Edel! I&#8217;m so excited for the opening of my site. When I first got Olivia&#8217;s{.external} email, I was scared to open it. But when I eventually did, I first saw:
&#8220;Congratulations!
You have been accepted!&#8221;
And then I screamed&#8230; I Twittered, Facebooked, and forum posted about it. No one really was as estatic as I was, but that was to be expected. I&#8217;m very excited for what this site can be turned into.

          My skool is posted on a band&#8217;s website! That&#8217;s never happened before. In the picture{.external}, the first school listed is my school. It was career day today and the day ended with the Absolute Presentation. I remember the presentation form last year. Last year was better but mainly because the band was better (Colin Lingren is amazing). But apparently the band that came to our school was better in terms of success.

          I think I&#8217;m going through a Japanese band phase. I think it really started with the theme songs for Gundam Seed Destiny, then Naruto, then Inu Yasha, then Bleach, and then Full Metal Alchemist. FMA mostly. If it wasnt for FMA I would have NEVER heard of L&#8217;Arc~En~Ciel.
L&#8217;Arc~en~Ciel is my number one fave Japanese band and my number one fave song by them is Link (which is the opening theme song for the FMA the Movie: The Conqueror of Shamballa).

One of my friends is already fourteen! She can get her learner&#8217;s permit nd she cant get over the fact she&#8217;s two years older than me. At least I&#8217;m not like my one friend. HHe doesnt turn thirteen until February.

          Today, my TA went to the church across the street to help out with the food hampers. Our job was to bring all 200 something boxes from the basement to the main floor. Do you know how hard that is? It was definitely a workout for me. I got my friend pat to help me with over half of my boxes and he calls me lazy. There was this freight elevator, and we had to bring carts full of food with it.

I also had a dream that Billie Joe Armstrong murdered someone and got into jail and went all crazy up in the mind.

          Three days ago, I started school, and I found out that we no longer have homerooms.

The principal and the vice principal! This is going to be one great year.
I have three of my friends in my TA and I have to stick with my TA Until I finish junior high&#8230; b=Vleh.

          Beauti is a pretty good band. Right now, they&#8217;re on tour with this thing called Absolute. They travel all across Canada to high schools. Which really doesn&#8217;t make any sense because I&#8217;m in junior high. Anyway, they played four songs (actually three, but they played one song while the kids went into the gym). I forget what one song was, but the two songs they played was Forever Love, and Don&#8217;t Watch Me.

I have been working on my religion project for the past four days. I&#8217;m finally finished now. Thank goodness. Who knew that a simple powerpoint about a saint would be so much work? I guess I&#8217;m too much of a perfectionist.

They saw my Billie Joe Armstrong poster (which unfortunately does not exist anymore because one of my friends tore it up).
