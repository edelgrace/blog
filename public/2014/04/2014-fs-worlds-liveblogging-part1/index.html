      <div class="content">
        <p>Okay, for two weeks I told myself that I would watch the Worlds for figure skating but now I have some time to watch some of it. In typical &#8220;me-fashion&#8221; these posts are purely for my own enjoyment (that is the philosophy of this blog anyway sp yes, I am extremely vain!). <strong>I KNOW ABSOLUTELY NOTHING ABOUT FIGURE SKATING.</strong> I just enjoy watching it. Read on if you dare!</p>

<p><strong>Opening ceremony</strong></p>

<p>Okay, I love the little figure skating girls! And I&#8217;m so sorry, but as they were doing the flag bit, I couldn&#8217;t help but think &#8220;that is how you use props, Adelina.&#8221; I&#8217;m so sorry&#8230; I like her but that just sprung into my mind&#8230;</p>

<p><strong>Pairs Short Program</strong></p>

<p>Wow, I picked a stream with absolutely no commentary. This is a little bit discomforting. Weird. Now I don&#8217;t know if something was truly &#8220;bad&#8221; or &#8220;good&#8221; in terms of how stuff should actually be done. Also, wow I can see their current score? This actually makes me so anxious.</p>

<p>But seriously, watching that score makes me nervous wow.</p>

<p><strong>Austria (Miriam Ziegler and Severin Kiefer)</strong></p>

<p>A bit slow at the end. They looked so disappointed when they were done though. Aweh, don&#8217;t frown, I enjoyed it!!</p>

<p><strong>Great Britain (Amani Fancy and Christopher Boyadji)</strong></p>

<p>I wish my last name was Fancy. Also, Fancy is 16 years old?? Whaaat?? Awehh Fancy, it&#8217;s okay that you missed that landing. Aweh, oh no I feel so bad! They way Fancy twirled down after that lift though, wow. That was beautiful. Happy birthday to that girl they mentioned.</p>

<p><strong>Ukraine (Julia Lavrentieva and Yuri Rudyk)</strong></p>

<p>Aweh, it looked like Lavrentieva made a two foot landing. Still looked impressive though. I hate it when skaters make mistakes early in their program because I don&#8217;t want them to worry too much and let it affect the rest of it. Kudos to the skaters who can overcome but it makes me worried too! Not sure if I&#8217;m digging their music a whole lot.</p>

<p>Is it just me or did the three first pairs have the same coach or something?? The dude(s?) who greeted all three of them look the same. Maybe I&#8217;m just not paying enough attention, lol.</p>

<p>Also, is this The Fray playing in the background? Lol what.</p>

<p>Omg no, I know this is the kiss and cry but nooo, please don&#8217;t cry!</p>

<p>Ahhh it&#8217;s the warm up and the <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> of the US pair just fell. Nooo don&#8217;t let it affect you, Zhang, noooo.</p>

<p>Aaaand now they&#8217;re playing Marianas Trench. Who picked this playlist?? Japan, please.</p>

<p><strong>Germany (Maylin Wende and Daniel Wende)</strong></p>

<p>Aweeh are they married?? Or siblings??<sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_1-737" id="back_ajs-fn-id_1-737">1</a></sup> Digging their song choice. Holy shoes, that lift was beautiful. And Maylin almost fell on that toss (throw?? I wonder what the real term is), but she saved it. You go girl! Spins are usually my favourite part about figure skating and I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll ever get used to how slow pairs are at those spins. And ommmg he kissed her when they finished. Awehhh. Now that is a ship I won&#8217;t feel guilty for shipping. Ommmg in the K and C, Maylin just made the cutest gesture.</p>

<p><strong>USA (Felicia Zhang and Nathan Bartholomay)</strong></p>

<p>Omg I&#8217;m so digging their song choice. Loving their speed. That toss flip thing was pretty fast as well. Gosh, that must take a whole lot of trust. And yeeah Zhang landed that jump. And the second one too. Also, I heard someone yell &#8220;YEAH!!!&#8221; in the stands, LOL. Omg, she&#8217;s soo cute.</p>

<p>Seriously, what is with this playlist playing in between each skate??</p>

<p>Wait, did they just lower their score from 35 to 33? Ouch.</p>

<p>Also, the dude that greeted them. Totally hot. Just saying.</p>

<p><strong>Italy (Nicole Della Monica and Matteo Guarise)</strong></p>

<p>The Japanese announcer said &#8220;Italy&#8221; in Japanese and I was so confused like &#8220;what does Hetalia (the anime) have to do with figure skating?&#8221; but then I remembered Hetalia is Italy in Japanese. I am seriously so ashamed right now. Loving their musicality so far. Ouch, that landing on the toss wasn&#8217;t A+. Oh no, a touch down on that jump. That costume on Guarise is not flattering at all. Costume designers, what are you doing??</p>

<p><strong>Russia (Julia Antipova and Nodari Maisuradze)</strong></p>

<p>Gooooo Russia. Antipova looks so darling and cute!! I love her costume too. She looks so tiny compared to Maisuradze! Omg. I can&#8217;t stop thinking about how tiny she is. I mean, she is 16 but Fancy is 16 too but Fancy isn&#8217;t as tiny as her. How werid is it for these 20-something guys to dance with 16 year old girls? Omg her Russian is great though.</p>

<p>Okay, I approve of them playing Panic! at the Disco. All the other music choices are iffy.</p>

<p><strong>Japan (Narumi Takahashi and Ryuichi Kihara)</strong></p>

<p>Oh no, they&#8217;re both soooo cute. Also, what?? Takahashi is 22 and Kihara 21?? Noooo way. She looks so young! They both look so young! Not a fan of Kihara&#8217;s outfit. Once again, costume designers, please. Ouch, only a 2.80 so far? Wait, it bumped up to 6.00. Still. Ouch. I&#8217;m loving their step-ish sequence part (I don&#8217;t know what it&#8217;s called, I don&#8217;t know what most things are called, I&#8217;m so sorry). Also, yesss. Loving their speed on their spins. Omg Ryuichi is sooo cute.</p>

<p><strong>Belruse (Maria Paliakova and Nikita Bochkov)</strong></p>

<p>Holy buff. Bochkov looks so buff and muscular. Or maybe it&#8217;s because male figure skaters just look too skinny. Loving Paliakova&#8217;s costume. Bochkov&#8217;s? Not so much. These poor men. Omg they&#8217;re both really cute, too. Omggg. What a beautiful language they&#8217;re speaking! Bochkov is too adorable in the Kiss and Cry.</p>

<p><strong>Estonia (Natalja Zabijako and Alexandr Zaboev)</strong></p>

<p>Zaboev&#8217;s hair is to die for. Why is it that these girls who are over 20 totally do not look like they&#8217;re over 20?? Loving Zabijako&#8217;s costume though. Also, wow, that spin toss thing. Wow. Pretty. The music choice is so fun. And ahhh they looked so synchronized in their jump. Wow, I&#8217;m so loving this program so far. Sad their technical score isn&#8217;t 100% great. Aweh. I&#8217;m hoping for a 50 from this pair. Aweh, 46.11 is still good!</p>

<p><strong>Bulgaria (Elizaveta Makarova and Leri Kenchadze)</strong></p>

<p>Wow, Kenchadze is smoking. Loving the song choice. So spicy. So high energy.</p>

<p>Aaaand my stream stopped working<sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_2-737" id="back_ajs-fn-id_2-737">2</a></sup>. I guess that means I should start working on my homework. Ugh, waiting for Hanyu is sheer tortue.</p>
