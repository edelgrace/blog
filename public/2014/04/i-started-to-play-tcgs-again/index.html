        <p>Since I gave up Tumblr for Lent, I realized how much free time I had on my hands without Tumblr. I decided, why not get back into TCGs? And so I did.</p>

<p>TCG stands for &#8220;Trading Card Game.&#8221; There are TCGs around the Internet that you can join as long as you yourself have a bit of space on the Internet. The goal of the game is basically to collect all the cards that are available in the game. They aren&#8217;t like the strategy TCGs where players duel against each other (in other words, it&#8217;s <strong>not like</strong> Magic: The Gathering or Yu-Gi-Oh!). However, you can trade cards with other players. To get cards, you have to play games like hangman, tic-tac-toe, etc. Some TCGs get really creative with the games but not all TCGs do.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t know what the appeal of TCGs are. I don&#8217;t even know how I got into TCGs in the first place!</p>

<p>The very first TCG I joined was called <em>Very Beauty</em>. The link is dead now and has been dead for quite a while. The site went on hiatus around the summer of 2012. It focused on Japanese music and entertainment. I mostly joined it for the music aspect. The cards I collected mostly were of rockers, haha. DIR EN GREY and L&#8217;Arc~en~Ciel, were of course, my main priorities! Unfortunately, I didn&#8217;t manage to master any decks while I was a part of that TCG.</p>

<p>Looking back on it now, I&#8217;m not a huge fan of the card templates. It was so confusing as there were two different sizes for the cards. It made it easier to distinguish the different card types but at the same time, it looked like clutter! Below are some of the cards, that I managed to snag before the site closed down. The first one is of hide from X JAPAN, the second is of the music video LEECH by The Gazette, and lastly, is the beautiful Acchan from Perfume!</p>

</p>

<p>However, my favourite TCG is <a href="http://rapture.lightning-blade.net/">Rapture</a>{.external}. This TCG is themed around boy pairings in animanga and video games. I&#8217;m actually not a huge fan of boy pairings, to be honest. It&#8217;s weird, I know! The only two boy pairings that I ship are Oreki and Fukube from <em>Hyouka</em> and Kaworu and Shinji from <em>Neon Genesis Evangelion</em>. But I joined this TCG anwyay. I just love the card templates! Rapture is definitely one of the prettiest TCGs out there right now.</p>

<p>Also, I&#8217;m actually pretty decent with this TCG! I&#8217;ve already mastered a couple of decks already. In fact, I think this is the only TCG where I have actually mastered any decks. Currently though, I&#8217;m working to master the Kaworu x Shinji deck. I just recently finished Evangelion, so that&#8217;s a fairly recent ship of mine.</p>

<p>But like, look at these cards&#8230; So pretty! Featuring Xanxus x Superbia Squalo from <em>Katekyo Hitman REBORN!</em>, Kaworu x Shinji from <em>NGE</em>, and Houtarou x Satoshi from <em>Hyouka</em>.</p>

</p>

<p>However, right now I&#8217;m waiting on a Japanese music TCG. There&#8217;s a couple that are inactive, which makes me sad! There are A LOT of Korean pop music TCGs floating around. I joined one of them. I don&#8217;t even listen to that much K-Pop. Needless to say, I&#8217;m mostly just collecting 2NE1, BIG BANG, AOA, Younha, and BoA decks right now. I also collect decks that have cute short haired girls in them. K-Pop girls are really cute, okay?</p>
