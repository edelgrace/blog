      <div class="content">
        <p>I write SO MUCH on Tumblr even though I have a blog sitting here just waiting to be used. I’m sorry. I’ll try to make this as painless as possible. Here are some posts I’ve made on Tumblr.</p>

<ul>
<li>I was listening to an episode of a certain podcast yesterday, which was recorded around the time when Andy got a tumblr and started stirring the pot with the SJ fan community. Dylan was trying to steer away the conversation from using ableism terms and Barb told Dylan that he had &#8220;So much to learn about the world.&#8221; That made me legitimately angry and sad because I really love Barb but no, you also have a lot to learn too. I wish I could be that blissfully and purposefully ignorant of all the problematic things that are going on in this world.</li>
<li>Sometimes I wish there were &#8220;readme for newbies&#8221; version for 99% of the readme files on GitHub because I’m really not that great at reading documentation and most readme files assume that I already know something but I don&#8217;t and I never know what it is that I should know because I don’t know it in the first place.</li>
<li>I&#8217;m watching FMA again because I still haven&#8217;t watched Brotherhood. The only thing that might disappoint me about Brotherhood is that I think L&#8217;Arc~en~Ciel isn’t on the soundtrack. Like FMA was THE reason why I listen to Japanese music today and I would be a whole different person if it wasn&#8217;t for FMA and L&#8217;Arc.<br />
Remember in media studies class I wrote an essay about FMA and my teacher read it out loud because she thought it was so good hahahaha good thing 90% of the class were my friends.</li>

<li><p>During one of my calculus lectures, we had just finished solving a problem and a girl asked my prof, &#8220;What does this number mean?&#8221; and my prof replied with, &#8220;It means nothing. It’s just a number.&#8221; The girl was getting all flustered but then my prof goes on to say, &#8220;YOU are the ones who give it meaning. You are the chemists and computer scientists. I just give you the tools for you to use in your major.&#8221;</p>

<p>To be honest, this is high school math in a nut shell. People go on about how high school math is useless because they&#8217;ll never need to integrate a curve but of course math will be useless to you if you don’t apply it appropriately. Ok, most people probably won’t need to know how to find the gradient of a vector if you’re a plumber or a lawyer but math IS useful in many fields. The math you learn in high school builds a foundation of skills for you if you ever need to take higher math which WILL more than likely be used in a way that will be helpful to you.</p>

<p>I just really love this calc prof. I’ve had him twice and he&#8217;s hands down one of my favourite profs at this university so far.</p></li>

<li><p>One time I went to park with my cousin who&#8217;s 8 and I was pushing him on the swing and he practically yelled, &#8220;Do one big ass push!!!&#8221; Of course, a parent nearby just gave us the death stare and I didn’t say anything but I think I should have said something like, &#8220;Cousin, watch your language!&#8221; I’m going to be a horrible parent if I ever become one.</p></li>
