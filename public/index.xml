      <title>Forever Tinkering with My Productivity System</title>

      <description>I follow the blog baty.net in which Jack Baty continuously finds new tools and new ways to improve his productivity. While I usually scoff at people who are always changing things up, I will admit that I am the exact same way. It would be great to just stick to something tried and true and never have to think about changing but there is just so much out there that it&amp;#8217;s hard for me to resist the temptation to not try everything I can see.</description>

      <title>FO: Candy Print Alpine Nights Beanie</title>

      <description>FO stands for &amp;#8220;finished object.&amp;#8221; It is a term used by knitters and crocheters.
 I recently finished a hat that my cousin asked me to make for her daughter. At first I wanted to knit a hat but I decided to crochet it instead. I looked through many different patterns and had trouble finding one that I liked the most. I settled on Alpine Nights because the pattern seemed not only simple but also very pretty.</description>

      <title>Book Review: The Vegetarian by Han Kang</title>

      <description>Yeong-hye and her husband are ordinary people. He is an office worker with moderate ambitions and mild manners; she is an uninspired but dutiful wife. The acceptable flatline of their marriage is interrupted when Yeong-hye, seeking a more &amp;#8216;plant-like&amp;#8217; existence, decides to become a vegetarian, prompted by grotesque recurring nightmares. In South Korea, where vegetarianism is almost unheard-of and societal mores are strictly obeyed, Yeong-hye&amp;#8217;s decision is a shocking act of subversion.</description>

      <description>A couple of days ago I was behind on my granny squares for my temperature blanket. If you don&amp;#8217;t know, temperature blankets consist of one square a day and each square represents the temperature of that day. Thankfully, it&amp;#8217;s easy to catch up with temperature blankets! Even though I&amp;#8217;m caught up with the squares, I still haven&amp;#8217;t woven the ends in yet nor have I joined them. Eek!
Last week I was babysitting my little cousin and he was playing with my yarn.</description>

      <title>Tempted by Static Pages Again</title>

      <description>I recently started learning how to use emacs, which is a text editor and a Lisp interpreter. During my quest for resources, I came across a number of developers and their blogs. Since I&amp;#8217;m always intrigued by what sort of tools developers use to make their blogs, I did a little snooping. A shocking number of people who didn&amp;#8217;t use WordPress as their blogging platform opted for flat files instead.</description>

      <description>I finally finished one Bernat Blanket Stripes cake! I am going to move onto cake number two for my afghan ripple blanket. I don&amp;#8217;t really know yet who this blanket will be for. My mom keeps asking me and I can&amp;#8217;t make up my mind. I am pretty happy that I am making progress on this blanket. I might need three cakes for this though and not the two that I have.</description>

      <description>Yesterday Yesterday opened up at their new location across the street. I dragged my brother along with me to the opening.
It was absolutely lovely! They had a DJ play some music in the background, a coffee bar, and a table of yummy sweets in the back. They even had door prizes, which I suspect I didn&amp;#8217;t win anything from but that&amp;#8217;s totally okay.
In terms of the space, it&amp;#8217;s great!</description>

      <title>First Time Crocheting on a Road Trip</title>

      <description>Over the weekend I went to Drumheller with the family. Up to this point I haven&amp;#8217;t had a chance to go on a long road trip with my crochet. I started this ripple afghan a couple of days ago with Bernat Blanket Stripes yarn. This blanket is intended for my cousins&amp;#8217;s newborn son. I guess he isn&amp;#8217;t quite so newborn now but every baby could use a blanket regardless! I actually restarted this blanket once or twice but I finally got the hang of it while on this trip.</description>

      <title>Stampede Food</title>

      <description>Honestly, Stampede is synonymous with food for me. Stampede means free breakfasts for a week. Usually these breakfasts consists of pancakes and sausages. We ended up going to six of these breakfasts. Some of them were worth it, some of them weren&amp;#8217;t. One of them actually ended up being $250 because my brother got fined for forgetting to validate his train ticket on the way to a breakfast. But still, a lot of pancakey goodness!</description>

      <description>While I&amp;#8217;m still looking for a job this summer (which is almost halfway over already&amp;#8230; Blah!) I took a cue from Y who started to work on some side projects and I decided to be a little more productive. Since I have a free month of Udacity from the GitHub Student Pack. Udacity is basically an online learning hub where you can take courses that are related to the tech field.</description>

      <title>FO #6: My Second Granny Square</title>

      <description>FO means &amp;#8220;finished object&amp;#8221; in crochet and knitter terms. So any completed project is a finished object!
 After making my first granny square, I quickly made my second granny square. Both were made from Loop &amp;amp; Threads yarn of the wool variety. I can&amp;#8217;t remember the exact name of the yarn.
I am not quite sure about the colour choices but they were the colours I had on hand of the same yarn.</description>

      <title>Winding Yarn Multitasking</title>

      <description>Since I recently started making a temperature blanket. I bought a couple of skeins of yarn (Bernat Premium, they are so soft!) and decided to wind them into balls to make transporting them easier for when/if I&amp;#8217;m on the go. Surprisingly, it takes a while for them to wind up. I thought it was a perfect opportunity to watch some TV shows while doing it.
I decided to finish up watching season 2 of Knights of Sidonia, an anime about a human space colony at war with alien-like creatures.</description>

      <description>The past couple of weeks I noticed that the MySQL service on my server would routinely stop out of the blue. At first I suspected that it was because my 512MB RAM wasn&amp;#8217;t enough but when I looked at the usage history, I never peaked more than 9%. I even tried reinstalling the MySQL server which worked at first but then it stopped running again.
However, I think the problem was due to bots trying to log into my WordPress dashboard.</description>

      <description>I went to the first pancake breakfast of the season with my family the other day. It was close to home which was a great bonus because my dad had the car for work. The breakfast wasn&amp;#8217;t busy at all but maybe being fairly early was a factor. They only served pancakes and sausage patties but they were pretty good! There was also a Tim Hortons truck giving out free coffee and hot chocolate.</description>
