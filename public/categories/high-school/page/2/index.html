          Yesterday was Thanksgiving in Canada land. I wasn&#8217;t able to post because of our super long but extremely satisfying dinner. Turkey, ham, and pasta for all! Not to mention that there was no school yesterday.
I said I was going to create passwords and give them out but that never really happened. It will happen sometime this week when I get around to it.
Today was rather interesting. Everyone was talking about post post.

          I love the song September by Earth Wind and Fire, so I just couldn&#8217;t help myself. On the 21st I sang the song throughout the whole day. I was tempted to go and play the song on my flute because I learned it, but I forgot where the music for the song went. Oh well. So, do you guys remember what happened on the 21st night of September?
Anyway, I&#8217;ve been contemplating this for a while.

          So I have vowed to write at least something everyday for this school year to document my final year in high school. Some of it will be published, some not. I also know most people don&#8217;t like &#8220;this is what I did this whole entire day&#8221; kind of posts but it is my blog, and well, I&#8217;ll blog whatever I want. :]
To start things off, today was rather ordinary. I woke up painfully early at six in the morning (well, it&#8217;s early if you&#8217;ve been sleeping in until noon for two months) because I heard my mom cooking.

          Over a week ago I went to the Stampede grounds to see Showbands Live. Showbands Live is an annual marching band competition. Every year there are the regulars (The Stetsons Calgary Showband, The Red Deer Royals, and Bishop Grandin Marching Ghosts). Last year I was part of the Ghosts and I wanted to support them and see them compete. This year there were a lot of American bands that were participating.

          Yesterday I started summer school. I said before that I had to take Religion 35 because it&#8217;s required to graduate and I have no room in my schedule for it next year. So, yesterday I woke up at 6:30 AM sharp, ate my breakfast, changed, and dashed out the door. Usually the first day of school isn&#8217;t intimidating but for some reason, the first day of summer school was extremely nerve wrecking.

Ah, so many things have happened since my last blog post. I don&#8217;t even remember half of it, haha.
On the 24th of March, instead of having a band practice, we had a concert! We got to wear the tuxedos! I always feel like a man in uniform.

Ahh, I&#8217;ve been doing too much gaming lately. Even though I&#8217;m only about 20 hours in on Dissidia: Final Fantasy, I love it! Like Cloud always says, I never want the game to end! It takes a long time to finish the game anyway.

So today was Marina&#8217;s (colour guard and clarinet) 16th birthday! And Andrew Lumapas came!! He&#8217;s for sure my hero. His YouTube vids are EPICALLY AMAZING. So amazing that I have to use all caps. Go check out his YouTube account{.
