      <title>My Last Day of Freedom</title>

      <description>Tomorrow I start university. Thank goodness for Labour day. I&amp;#8217;ve never really understood what Labour day is. All I know is that it delays school by one more day and that&amp;#8217;s all I need to know to be thankful for it. To be honest, I&amp;#8217;m not at all that excited to be honest. Technically, classes don&amp;#8217;t start until next week so that&amp;#8217;s delayed even further.
This week is all orientation. Basically, just having fun and getting to know the campus and mingling with other potential classmates.</description>

      <description>Lent is finally over. :) My journey with no interent was&amp;#8230; Not very successful but I managed to go by with minimal (emphasis on minimal) internet. I mostly dedicated myself to YouTube on the &amp;#8220;play all&amp;#8221; function so that was interesting. It&amp;#8217;s weird because I had the strongest urge to blog throughout the forty days. Very odd, I thought I would just forget about it but it wasn&amp;#8217;t the case at all.</description>

      <description>Today, my high school hosted a blood donation centre. I wanted to donate blood because, well, it&amp;#8217;s for a good cause, right? I drank tons of water the day of and the day before so in my morning classes I was going to the washroom a whole lot. So, I went to donate blood during lunch time. I filled out a form, got a drop of blood tested for my iron level, answered some questions (sexual history, travelling, and any other things that could influence whether or not my blood is good to donate or not).</description>

      <description>January was a mostly boring month. Filled with studying, tears, gaming, eating, sleeping, more tears, and a bit more studying. The only exciting day was yesterday, which was the first day of the semester. The last semester of high school. Oh, the end is near.
One of my the girls in my section told me that there was band practice the morning of the first day of semester. I went to school at seven and&amp;#8230; No band practice.</description>

      <description>Finally, my final exams are over! I only wrote math and chemistry but I studied my butt off for both of them. Yesterday I had chemistry. It was mad hard but I have to admit that I studied math more than I did for chemistry. I did go to a diploma prep for chemistry which somewhat helped. Math was super easy but I&amp;#8217;m still worried over it. Super easy could mean that it was really super easy or that I just thought it was easy when in reality, I did everything wrong.</description>

      <description>Yesterday was my last day of school. It was pretty pointless as it was a half day and each class was half an hour long. We also had band practice in the morning! Thankfully it was cut short because the band teachers had to go carol with the other teachers at the front of the school. They actually sounded pretty good. I was expecting horrible off key belting and such but no.</description>

      <title>My Reading in 2011</title>

      <description>Whoot~ I got 94% on my chem test! However, I wrote a physics test today and I just know that didn&amp;#8217;t go very well. I have a math test tomorrow so as soon as I finish writing this post, I&amp;#8217;m going to go study.
Last year around this time, I set a goal for myself: read 100 books before 2011 ends. I&amp;#8217;m an avid manga reader and I can finish one volume of manga in an hour so a week into the challenge I found that I was already a quarter of the way through the challenge (keep in mind this was during winter break, haha).</description>

      <description>This morning was a great morning! Most band practices aren&amp;#8217;t that exciting but this one was pretty good. We played the opener and the second song of the show. In marching band, the members run around a football field making pretty shapes while playing their instruments. Those 11 minutes of organized chaos is what we call a show. At my highschool we have a marching band. I&amp;#8217;m in band but I don&amp;#8217;t march because of money and time issues.</description>

      <title>It’s December…</title>

      <description>Yes, it is finally December!
The first day of December was okay. In math I got my last unit test back. 91%! But then I got my quiz back. 64%! My marks have such variety, don&amp;#8217;t they? I felt like my math teacher was giving me disappointed looks all through class because I did so bad on this quiz. This unit we&amp;#8217;re doing, permutations and combinations, is really weird for me.</description>

      <title>It Smells Like Highschool</title>

      <description>Last week we got our yearbooks from last year. I dislike the fact that they give it out in the new school year since not all of those who graduated can come back and sign the yearbooks of those who were left behind. But I guess it takes a while to get all of the pictures, design each of the pages, send it to the company, physically make it, and then ship it back to us.</description>

      <title>Long Weekend!</title>

      <description>I understand that it is almost Thanksgiving in the States so others have long weekends as well. But our reasons for the long weekend are because of parent teacher interviews tomorrow and Rememberance day the after.
Speaking of Rememberance day, today was the Rememberance celebration at my school. Since I go to a Catholic school, the celebration is held at the church behind the school. It&amp;#8217;s a short walk across the field and into the parking lot but it was chilly.</description>

      <description>Yesterday was Thanksgiving in Canada land. I wasn&amp;#8217;t able to post because of our super long but extremely satisfying dinner. Turkey, ham, and pasta for all! Not to mention that there was no school yesterday.
I said I was going to create passwords and give them out but that never really happened. It will happen sometime this week when I get around to it.
Today was rather interesting. Everyone was talking about post post.</description>

      <title>Do You Remember the 21st night of September?</title>

      <description>I love the song September by Earth Wind and Fire, so I just couldn&amp;#8217;t help myself. On the 21st I sang the song throughout the whole day. I was tempted to go and play the song on my flute because I learned it, but I forgot where the music for the song went. Oh well. So, do you guys remember what happened on the 21st night of September?
Anyway, I&amp;#8217;ve been contemplating this for a while.</description>

      <description>So I have vowed to write at least something everyday for this school year to document my final year in high school. Some of it will be published, some not. I also know most people don&amp;#8217;t like &amp;#8220;this is what I did this whole entire day&amp;#8221; kind of posts but it is my blog, and well, I&amp;#8217;ll blog whatever I want. :]
To start things off, today was rather ordinary. I woke up painfully early at six in the morning (well, it&amp;#8217;s early if you&amp;#8217;ve been sleeping in until noon for two months) because I heard my mom cooking.</description>

      <description>Over a week ago I went to the Stampede grounds to see Showbands Live. Showbands Live is an annual marching band competition. Every year there are the regulars (The Stetsons Calgary Showband, The Red Deer Royals, and Bishop Grandin Marching Ghosts). Last year I was part of the Ghosts and I wanted to support them and see them compete. This year there were a lot of American bands that were participating.</description>
