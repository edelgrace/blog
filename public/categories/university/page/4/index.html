          My heart hasn&#8217;t gone doki doki in a while. The last time I can remember is when I was in my freshman year of high school when I was crushing on my first boyfriend1. This was, of course, before last Friday.
On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays I have my first class with three of my friends. We all have a break after the class so we eat together. Last Friday, we decided to eat in the ICT building.

        <div class="content">
          Even though yesterday technically has a post, I did not post it until today. Therefore, I missed a day. Being the procrastinator that I am, I usually leave these blog posts until around 11:00pm at night, when I&#8217;m lying in bed. However, last night I was not lying in bed. Instead, I was seated in front of my brother&#8217;s laptop, trying to finish an essay. My essay was not due today but I ended up staying up until 3:30 in the morning working on it.

          Moments like these, I question my desire to go to graduate school. I have a paper to write by Friday. I was told to basically start over and I&#8217;m stuck. It&#8217;s on a novel and we&#8217;re supposed to pull out symbols for it and I&#8217;m just drawing a blank. My prof started connecting some of them and I tried to follow suit but they&#8217;re too far fetched. I&#8217;m really frustrated and I don&#8217;t know what to do!

          I am almost done my first month of my second year at university! It&#8217;s been an interesting year leading up to now. I got into university, turned 18, hated engineering with a passion, sucked at engineering with a passion, went to the Philippines, switched majors (in a transition major right now until I can switch into computer science please don&#8217;t ask me what it is), got a job as a cashier at Walmart over the summer (don&#8217;t ask me about that either please), got my courses for this semester dropped, went to fix my schedule, found out it wasn&#8217;t actually fixed and didn&#8217;t find out until a few days into the first week, and went to go fix it yet again.

          These days, most people are going paperless. With things like &#8220;the cloud&#8221; and thousands of web and mobile apps that can do almost anything you want, it wouldn&#8217;t be hard. However, I&#8217;m going the opposite way. I&#8217;m going back to paper.
Why on earth would I possibly want to do this? Easy. Smartphones, while useful, also carry a lot of temptations. Sure, you can have 10 note-taking, productivity, schedule apps but you also have an Internet browser, a music player, and quite possibly, a nice library of games.

          I quit Tumblr for Lent. It&#8217;s only been a couple of days, and I&#8217;ve accumulated so many Tumblr blog posts in my mind and it&#8217;s kinda driving me crazy. So crazy to the point where a Tumblr and serious blog crossover is inevitable. Tumblr posts are mostly Twitter-like in nature, except ten times the sarcasm, ten times the ironic usage of poor grammar and spelling, and ten times that length.

          My New Year&#8217;s resolutions aren&#8217;t going so well. I&#8217;m pretty sure I&#8217;ve broken at least half of them already! But that doesn&#8217;t mean I&#8217;m giving up on them. I&#8217;m starting fresh this week, and I will get stuff done.
This week is going to be tough. I have two midterms on subjects that I have absolutely no idea on what&#8217;s going on. I didn&#8217;t study as much as I wanted to on the weekend.

          A new year, a new set of resolutions, probably another year where said resolutions are never fulfilled. But it doesn&#8217;t hurt to at least dream, yeah? Usually most people do these resolution posts on the first day of the year, but I do mine second! No, I was busy with the opening of my new blog{.external}, go check it out. On with the post!
1. Post more I hate how this has to be a resolution, but yes, I want to post more.

Whew, I finally made it through my very first semester in university. I must say, it was quite a ride. I&#8217;m glad I got through it. Finals are behind me and now I can just relax. Even though I do want to take this time to chill out and slow down the pace, I also want to be productive.

          Two blog posts in a week?? Is this even possible? I&#8217;m probably dreaming but it&#8217;s happening. For real.
Whenever I first get on the computer, I find myself starting out pretty darn focused. I open up Blackboard, see what&#8217;s new, check my falling grades, cry, start on my assignments, etc. Then suddenly it&#8217;s 1 in the morning (I&#8217;m exaggerating, the latest I&#8217;ve started homework was like 10pm&#8230; Still pretty bad though).

          Usually I bring a textbook with me on the train to study from but today I had only one lecture and I definitely forgot to bring one. So I decided it would be good to write a blog post for once because I really do miss writing these things.
Christmas is indeed in the air! Last week in the food court on campus, Christmas carols were playing and a Santa was walking around asking for donations for some charity.
