      <title>Not Another Love Story</title>

      <description>In a way, I don&amp;#8217;t want to read stories about (romantic) love anymore. Too much emphasis is put on love, whether it be on screen, in print, or just in life in general. Not that I&amp;#8217;m saying that love isn&amp;#8217;t important, because it is important. How a character approaches love can speak volumes about their personality. But I just don&amp;#8217;t want it to be the main plot, or even a sub-plot.</description>

      <description>Long weird sappy feelings. So much sap and cheese and this sounded better in my head because I kinda read it in a certain way. Man, I just don’t know. Also, for the love of gulay, the end of a line does not mean &amp;#8220;pause.&amp;#8221; Punctuation means &amp;#8220;pause.&amp;#8221; Yes, you’re supposed to run out of breath (I&amp;#8217;m kinda slightly asthmatic though, so).
i’m sorry,
but i won’t ever text you again</description>

      <description>The sun cleared up his eyes and I was instantly lost.
Even when his head turned towards mine
I could not and would not tear mine away from his.
That colour!
I had never experienced it before.
Warm and clear.
I could see forever in his eyes.
I could feel his disappointment
when he looked into mine: an endless dirt pit.
But he smiled at me then, a sweet crooked grin</description>

      <description>I don&amp;#8217;t really know what to write about in my blog right now. At first I was like &amp;#8220;post everyday!&amp;#8221; but when I got to it, I drew a blank. Not to mention, the 500 words requirement overwhelms me. What can I write about for 500 words??That&amp;#8217;s why I already missed more than four days of posting. A &amp;#8220;blog post idea&amp;#8221; list would be very hand right now. I gotta start writing down said ideas.</description>

      <description>Moments like these, I question my desire to go to graduate school. I have a paper to write by Friday. I was told to basically start over and I&amp;#8217;m stuck. It&amp;#8217;s on a novel and we&amp;#8217;re supposed to pull out symbols for it and I&amp;#8217;m just drawing a blank. My prof started connecting some of them and I tried to follow suit but they&amp;#8217;re too far fetched. I&amp;#8217;m really frustrated and I don&amp;#8217;t know what to do!</description>
