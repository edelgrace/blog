      <description>So I started this post with me sitting in my office with Wheat Thins in hand, waiting for the Microsoft Press Conference to start via Twitch. The sound was clear, virtually no lag (unless I decided to open a gazillion tabs), and pretty good quality for just 360p. I never realized how huge E3 is. The venue for the Microsoft Press Conference is flipping huge. Seeing the crowd and the green glow absolutely sets the atmosphere.</description>

      <description>While I can&amp;#8217;t say I&amp;#8217;m a huge gamer, I game enough to be excited about E3 that&amp;#8217;s starting tomorrow. There is a ton of stuff that are coming out that will hopefully be super crazy due to the next gen consoles that are coming this year. So, here&amp;#8217;s what I&amp;#8217;ll be keeping my eyes glued to the screen on over the next few days.
PS4 Console They showed us the controller, they showed us the features, and they showed us the games.</description>

      <title>I Don’t Know</title>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve been really unmotivated lately. I should be busy with school, but I really am not. Little things keep on discouraging me and causes me to lose sight of the end goal. I don&amp;#8217;t know what&amp;#8217;s wrong with me. I keep telling myself, &amp;#8220;This is your future at stake! Do you really want to be working 2 or 3 part time jobs?&amp;#8221; But even so, it does nothing. I&amp;#8217;m at the point where I seriously think, even for a second, to hell with society.</description>

      <title>I Enjoy Being Lazy</title>

      <description>Currently I&amp;#8217;m writing to you from my shiny new WordPress app on my iPod! I&amp;#8217;m seriously grateful for the WordPress app. I do 90% of my blogging on my iPod anyway. The only mobile thing about the admin section of WordPress is the login page. Typing long things in Safari is a pain as well. It crashes way too often in Safari. Plus, this app is just distraction free. When you&amp;#8217;re typing, it&amp;#8217;s just that: you typing.</description>

      <description>Most people&amp;#8217;s first post of the year is on the first, but no, I&amp;#8217;m unique and I&amp;#8217;ll have mine six days later. I&amp;#8217;ve been busy studying and working on Room 304. I&amp;#8217;m actually being productive. Okay, yesterday and the day before I didn&amp;#8217;t study at all and now I&amp;#8217;m freaking out because I have a test on Monday. What do I do about it? I post on my blog. Oh the life of a procrastinator.</description>
