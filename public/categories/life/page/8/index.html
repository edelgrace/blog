        <div class="content">
          I went out with some friends today. It&#8217;s funny because every time we go to this ramen place, our local anime convention has an event. Last time it was their mini winter com and this time they were having a trading pin party up at the university.
But yeah we went to eat ramen. It was yummy. And then we bought candy. That was yummy as well.
But my friends also gave me presents which was really weird wow.

          My exams ended relatively early last semester. That meant more time for a break! I didn&#8217;t do terribly a lot over through break though. Definitely was not as productive as I would have liked to be.
Finished watching and reading Shingeki no Kyojin
Shingeki no Kyojin is an anime. The Internet has been basically exploding over it (my part of the Internet anyway). My friends in real life also freak out over it and so much so that I just had to see what they were on about.

          Write a blog post every week
Writing a blog post every day is pretty much impossible for me. However, I still want to post regularly. Posting weekly sounds pretty doable for me. There are 168 hours in a week. If I can&#8217;t fit in at least one blog post in there, I&#8217;m going to have to rethink my current time management system.
Spend less than 30 minutes on YouTube everyday

          That moment when your TA is looking at you not so subtly. Or maybe I just have sucky peripheral vision. WOW I really hope the latter is not the case. Man, my heart is so doki doki when I think about him. Much dork. :(

        <div class="content">
          This semester went by really quickly. I never once thought, &#8220;wow I want this semester to be over.&#8221; I&#8217;m not joking, really! I really enjoyed it. Then again, it could be due to the fact that I only took three courses this semester: introduction to Python, Russian literature in translation, and linear algebra. They were all pretty fair courses. I already had some programming experience (once you are exposed one programming language, it&#8217;s easier to read other languages), my Russian professor was quite easy, and I knew most of the content in linear algebra.

        <div class="content">
           I&#8217;m lazy.  It&#8217;s expensive. Out of the three times I&#8217;ve worn makeup in my life, I felt more self conscious with makeup than without. I feel like a clown. It physically feels weird on my face. If y&#8217;all don&#8217;t love me without the makeup but love me with it, I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;d want to wear it in the first place.

          I don&#8217;t miss people much. Usually when I&#8217;m away from people, I feel relieved. Relaxed. At peace. Almost happy.
However, when things go bad, there&#8217;s one person I long for.
Then I realize I can&#8217;t text him. I can&#8217;t pull up Facebook and chat with him.
What I&#8217;m feeling is selfish. So selfish.
I wish he was here so he could help me and I could talk to him about everything.

          Yesterday1 I chatted a bit with my senpai. He was so adorable. :( Now I&#8217;m sure he does not have feelings for me which is both a relief and a disappointment at the same time. Relief because lol that could get too complicated and a disappointment because he&#8217;s so cute. D:
However, today I did talk to him. I asked him how his weekend was. Apparently it was bad. He spent the whole weekend writing an eleven page paper about network systems and stuff.

          Last Saturday I went out with my friends to go eat lunch. I wish I took pictures but I didn&#8217;t realize my outing could be a potential blog post until yesterday, when I was writing yesterday&#8217;s blog post. I usually don&#8217;t make a habit of taking pictures of my food either. People who do that to post them on Twitter and Instagram annoy me. Sorry to everyone I just offended. I just want to eat your food okay.

          My heart hasn&#8217;t gone doki doki in a while. The last time I can remember is when I was in my freshman year of high school when I was crushing on my first boyfriend1. This was, of course, before last Friday.
On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays I have my first class with three of my friends. We all have a break after the class so we eat together. Last Friday, we decided to eat in the ICT building.
