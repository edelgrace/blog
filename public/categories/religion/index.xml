      <description>I quit Tumblr for Lent. It&amp;#8217;s only been a couple of days, and I&amp;#8217;ve accumulated so many Tumblr blog posts in my mind and it&amp;#8217;s kinda driving me crazy. So crazy to the point where a Tumblr and serious blog crossover is inevitable. Tumblr posts are mostly Twitter-like in nature, except ten times the sarcasm, ten times the ironic usage of poor grammar and spelling, and ten times that length.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As a Catholic, I&amp;#8217;m always working towards understanding my faith, living my faith, properly representing my faith, and lately: being in harmony with those who do not share my faith. A couple of years ago, I was an ignorant little brat, believing myself better than others who didn&amp;#8217;t actually identify as Catholic despite going to a Catholic school. That mentality quickly faded away once high school began but that didn&amp;#8217;t mean that I became &amp;#8220;any less Catholic.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried my best to keep a delicate balance between my more secular values and my, well, not so secular values. It&amp;#8217;s hard. I still try to do this today. More often than not, my secular values seem to dominate over everything else but I still have this longing to grow in my faith and fully live it out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier on this semester, the campus bookstore was having a hallway sale. It was my break time, I had nothing better to do and the prices seemed cheap enough, so I went ahead and browsed for around half an hour. There were a couple of books that intrigued me but there was one book that kept me coming back to it. &amp;#8220;Through the Narrow Gate: Life In and Out of the Convent&amp;#8221; by Karen Armstrong.&lt;/p&gt;
