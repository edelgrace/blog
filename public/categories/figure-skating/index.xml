      <description>Okay, for two weeks I told myself that I would watch the Worlds for figure skating but now I have some time to watch some of it. In typical &amp;#8220;me-fashion&amp;#8221; these posts are purely for my own enjoyment (that is the philosophy of this blog anyway sp yes, I am extremely vain!). I KNOW ABSOLUTELY NOTHING ABOUT FIGURE SKATING. I just enjoy watching it. Read on if you dare!

      <description>The Monday after reading week is always the worst, that is. I told my friend who is from the States that I had reading week and she had no idea what it is. It&amp;#8217;s pretty much a Canadian/Commonwealth countries thing where we get a couple days off in the middle of the semester. I heard from the grapevine that reading week started because mid-semester is a period when too stressed out students tend to commit suicide.</description>
