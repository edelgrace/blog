      <description>I tried to cook more during the month of May. Partly because my mother was out of the country and then cooking was left to us but also because I&amp;#8217;m trying my best to learn how to cook. Unfortunately, most of what I cooked was pretty simple but I still managed to cook some things. I didn&amp;#8217;t take pictures of everything I cooked, although I totally should have.

      <description>I can count the number of times I have tried to make cheesecake on one hand. It&amp;#8217;s not that many but I count that as a quest to make the ultimate cheesecake. It&amp;#8217;s my favourite dessert. Yes, it&amp;#8217;s incredibly filling and calorie dense and expensive but I love it. The expensiveness factor is a big reason why I&amp;#8217;m trying to perfect the art of the cheesecake.
On my first attempt back in high school, it tasted lke cream cheese on a graham cracker crust.</description>
