      <div class="content">
        <p>Okay, I&#8217;ve decided that <a href="http://room304.brokenphrases.info/">Room 304</a> is now officially a book log/archive with minimal blog posts. This calls for a redesign that will emphasize the fact. Why the change? It was always my intention to have Room 304 solely as a book log. But as I heard about book blogging, I decided I would give it a chance. It overshadowed the logging aspect of the site, and I didn&#8217;t feel like I wanted to update the site anymore. So yes, a &#8220;new&#8221; focus for Room 304!</p>

<p>That being said, the blogging part is <strong>not</strong> going away. However, it definitely will not be frequent. I&#8217;ll just be posting the books I&#8217;ve bought and/or borrowed from the library. Sometimes I&#8217;ll do stuff like Follow Fridays (minus the following) and other memes like that but those will be even rarer. So yes. My library haul for the month!</p>

<p>I actually took these books out on the 9th. I&#8217;ve neglected to post about it but better late than never! I&#8217;m actually returning a few of them today. In fact, I&#8217;ve finished reading all of the books except one. Mind you, 80% of the books are manga and/or are &#8220;easy&#8221; reads.</p>

<p>So here&#8217;s the list!</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Message from an Unknown Chinese Mother: Stories of Loss and Love by Xinran</strong><br />
While I was doing my daily browsing of all the aisles in the library, I came across this little gem! I wanted to take it out before, but I felt like I had too many books on my plate. So I came back and got it now!</li>
<li><strong>Alcestis by Katharine Beutner</strong><br />
This caught my eye right away because I really love Greek myths. Especially anything to do with the Underworld. Hades you beast. And poor, sweet, dear, precious <del>fefeta</del> Persephone.</li>
<li><strong>Assassin&#8217;s Creed: Forsaken by Oliver Bowden</strong><br />
As soon as I realized that the library actually had Assassin&#8217;s Creed books, I had to grab them! I&#8217;ve heard about this book among the fandom and a lot of people love it. Mostly because Haytham is in it? Seeing as how it&#8217;s a journal of pretty much his entire life, I was intrigued. I also can&#8217;t bear to miss any piece of canon media.</li>
<li><strong>Assassin&#8217;s Creed: Renaissance by Oliver Bowden</strong><br />
Saw this one right next to Forsaken. No regrets.</li>
<li><strong>Kimi Ni Todoke (Volumes 1-7) by Karuho Shiina</strong><br />
This series has been on my to-read list for the looongest time. It&#8217;s almost been over three years, actually! I&#8217;ve put it off because it&#8217;s licensed in English (I know, I&#8217;m horrible). As soon as I saw several volumes starting from the very beginning, I grabbed them all.</li>
<li><strong>Cirque du Freak (Volumes 8-12) by Darren Shan and Takahiro Arai</strong><br />
Okay, I&#8217;ve been reading this series for around two years. These are the final volumes. I just have to finish what I started!</li>
<li><strong>The Limit (Volumes 1 &amp; 2) by Keiko Suenobu</strong><br />
I&#8217;m a big fan of Keiko Suenobu. I&#8217;ve read most of her series, <em>Life</em> and a couple of her works. I&#8217;ve always had a soft spot for over dramatic high school kids. On a more serious note, Suenobu loves to focus on bullying and I just love the awareness she&#8217;s trying to spread. She&#8217;s always a good read!</li>
