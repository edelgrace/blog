      <div class="content">
        <p>It&#8217;s no secret to many people that L&#8217;Arc~en~Ciel is my favourite band. No, not one of my favourite bands, but my <strong><em>favourite</em></strong> band. Previously, my favourite band had been Green Day, from about grade four to junior high school. They were a great band for me at the time but they didn&#8217;t have a timeless feel to them. After listening to L&#8217;Arc~en~Ciel, I quickly dumped them.</p>

<p>When I was in junior high I even wrote an essay about how L&#8217;Arc~en~Ciel had impacted my life. My teacher loved it and even read it out loud for the class. Thank gosh that was an elective class that comprised mostly of friends or acquaintances. I so wish I still had that essay!</p>

<p>Basically, my journey with L&#8217;Arc~en~Ciel started, like for many people, with the anime Full Metal Alchemist. <em>Ready, Steady, Go!</em> was one of the opening theme songs to Full Metal Alchemist. I didn&#8217;t like it as much, to be honest. The vocalist<sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_1-111" id="back_ajs-fn-id_1-111">1</a></sup> had a really low voice that I wasn&#8217;t a fan of.</p>

<p>Then I watched Full Metal Alchemist: The Conqueror of Shambala. I thought it was a great movie. The opening for the movie was <em>Link</em> and the ending was <em>Lost Heaven</em>. I loved those two songs so much after listening to them just once that I went ahead and downloaded most of L&#8217;Arc~en~Ciel&#8217;s discography. I fell in love with them and loved everything they did.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve gone in and out of being obsessed with L&#8217;Arc~en~Ciel. These days I definitely do not listen to them as much as I used to but I still listen to them a lot. Every time I listen to one of their songs, I just feel this weird calm come over me and I feel immersed in the music. It&#8217;s almost like I&#8217;m falling in love with them all over again each time. Their songs just never seem to get old<sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_2-111" id="back_ajs-fn-id_2-111">2</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Some of my favourite L&#8217;Arc~en~Ciel songs:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Forbidden Lover</strong><br />
By far my favourite song, ever. It just has a haunted and powerful sound. Utterly tragic and beautiful. Every member shines, even if I can&#8217;t hear the bassist<sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_3-111" id="back_ajs-fn-id_3-111">3</a></sup> 90% of the time.</li>
<li><strong>Link</strong><br />
That song I talked about earlier? An oldie but a goodie. I used to get choked up listening to this song. Now? Not so much. Granted, I do feel a bit emotional when I listen to it. I think it&#8217;s the nostalgia factor.</li>
<li><strong>Time Goes On</strong><br />
One of the really singable songs. I think this song just represents a really great era for the band. It&#8217;s not hard core but not mellow either. I think Hyde&#8217;s vocals really stand out in this one.</li>
<li><strong>All Dead</strong><br />
This song is older than I am<sup class="footnote"><a href="#foot_ajs-fn-id_4-111" id="back_ajs-fn-id_4-111">4</a></sup> but I find it to be a classic. In the band&#8217;s beginning, their sound was <em>very</em> Spanish rock. I just fell in love with the guitar in this song. It gets in my head and it does this weird thing to my emotions.</li>
<li><strong>Niji</strong><br />
This is a classic song. Apparently most of their concerts end with this song and I can see why. It sounds like a plea or a very heartbroken goodbye. The vocals are very powerful and almost on the brink of screaming while still sounding beautiful. The song just jumps right in and you&#8217;re immediately hit with these emotions.</li>
<li><strong>4th Avenue Cafe</strong><br />
One of those carefree songs that I really like! I alway want to jump or dance or just sing along whenever I listen to this. It just makes me so <em>happy</em>. At the same time, it also makes me emotional! It&#8217;s just another one of those trademark L&#8217;Arc~en~Ciel songs that you listen to and you just feel like, &#8220;Without this song, L&#8217;Arc~en~Ciel would not be L&#8217;Arc~en~Ciel.&#8221;</li>
