      <h1 class="title">13 Resolutions for 2013</h1>
      
      <div class="content">
        

<p>A new year, a new set of resolutions, probably another year where said resolutions are never fulfilled. But it doesn&#8217;t hurt to at least dream, yeah? Usually most people do these resolution posts on the first day of the year, but I do mine second! No, I was busy with the opening of <a href="http://thelibrariancode.com">my new blog</a>{.external}, go check it out. On with the post!</p>

<h2 id="1-post-more">1. Post more</h2>

<p>I hate how this has to be a resolution, but yes, I want to post more. Mostly for my sanity and to make sure that the money I spend on domains are actually worth it (broke university student is broke, I need a job). Plus, I want to look back on my blogs and read my posts and reminisce because I like reminiscing.</p>

<h2 id="2-catch-up-on-my-book-log-at-least-a-little">2. Catch up on my book log, at least a little</h2>

<p>In my <a href="/getting-through-it/">last blog post</a>, one of my goals for the Christmas break was to catch on my book log, <a href="http://room304.brokenphrases.info">Room 304</a>{.external}. My total goal for this year is to add 200 hundred more books to the database.</p>

<h2 id="3-spend-only-an-hour-per-week-on-tumblr">3. Spend only an hour per week on Tumblr</h2>

<p>Last week I spent 3 hours on Tumblr, which is AMAZING compared to my all time record of 12 hours of Tumblr during a <strong>school</strong> week. I&#8217;m a bit ashamed of that statistic. I&#8217;ve been trying to post less and browse less so hopefully that 3 hours will dwindle down to less than an hour soon! So far, it&#8217;s Wednesday and I&#8217;ve already spent 1 hour on Tumblr, but some of this week wasn&#8217;t 2013 so I&#8217;ll let that slide. But no more Tumblr for the rest of the week!</p>

<h2 id="4-don-8217-t-gain-weight-lose-more-than-5-pounds">4. Don&#8217;t gain weight/lose more than 5 pounds</h2>

<p>Most of my days are spent sitting around &#8220;doing&#8221; school work or trying to get ahead in programming languages. As you can guess, the pounds have been adding up. I&#8217;m short so even gaining a pound shows (unfortunately). I want to stay the weight I am now, but if I start unintentionally losing weight (haha that&#8217;s funny), I don&#8217;t want to lose too much weight. Five pounds sounds like a good number.</p>

<h2 id="5-don-8217-t-skip-any-lectures">5. Don&#8217;t skip any lectures</h2>

<p>Last semester I spent a lot of time &#8220;rearranging&#8221; lecture time to work on labs or projects (ENGG 200/design was a pain in the butt) or studying for mid-terms. I shouldn&#8217;t have done that but the temptation is too great. Especially when you find yourself sitting in a lecture that should have 200+ students but only 3 rows of seats are filled and the professor isn&#8217;t making any sense.</p>

<h2 id="6-stop-doing-assignments-the-day-before">6. Stop doing assignments the day before</h2>

<p>I&#8217;m so guilty of doing this. Last semester a lot of my assignments were due either on Friday, Saturday, Sunday, or Monday. As a result, a lot of procrastination was done. I need to get out of this habit and quick.</p>

<h2 id="8-be-productive-during-reading-week">8. Be productive during reading week</h2>

<p>Reading week is a &#8220;week&#8221;/period preceding examinations according to Wikipedia. Last semester, reading week came along and I was so pumped. &#8220;I&#8217;m going to do so much studying and do all of my homework!&#8221; Did it happen? Nope.</p>

<h2 id="9-actually-finish-some-reading-challenges">9. Actually finish some reading challenges</h2>

<p>Click <a href="http://room304.brokenphrases.info/2012-reading-challenges">here</a>{.external} and look at my pitiful attempt at all of those reading challenges. I want to read a lot of books in 2012 but nope, that didn&#8217;t happen. I&#8217;m only doing 2 challenges this year, the A-Z challenge and to read 100 books (manga and novels).</p>

<h2 id="10-make-something-for-github">10. Make something for GitHub</h2>

<p>I made a GitHub account but it&#8217;s very empty and lonely. I need something to work on as a side project. I just want something <strong>there</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="11-keep-in-touch-with-my-spiritual-side">11. Keep in touch with my spiritual side</h2>

<p>In light of all of the crazy things going around me, I want to always keep in mind of the bigger (spiritual) picture. It&#8217;s so easy to lose focus. Admittedly, I haven&#8217;t been the most &#8220;Catholic&#8221; person ever but I hope that will change.</p>

<h2 id="12-3-0-gpa-for-this-semester">12. 3.0 GPA for this semester</h2>

<p>If other people can do it, so can I! I&#8217;m aiming for the 3.0. It will come. IT WILL. No longer shall I be dangerously tip toeing the line between passing and failing!</p>

<h2 id="13-get-a-summer-job">13. Get a summer job</h2>

<p>This is the most important one. I have no volunteer (unless altar serving counts) or work experience. How awful would that look if it stayed that way until I graduated? I need a summer job. Thank goodness summer is so long (four months, thank you so much). Hopefully I can actually find a job with my lack of experience&#8230;</p>
