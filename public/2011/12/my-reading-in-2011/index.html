        <p>Whoot~ I got 94% on my chem test! However, I wrote a physics test today and I just know that didn&#8217;t go very well. I have a math test tomorrow so as soon as I finish writing this post, I&#8217;m going to go study.</p>

<p>Last year around this time, I set a goal for myself: read 100 books before 2011 ends. I&#8217;m an avid manga reader and I can finish one volume of manga in an hour so a week into the challenge I found that I was already a quarter of the way through the challenge (keep in mind this was during winter break, haha). So I increased my goal to 500 books. That went along nicely&#8230; Until summer came. During the summer, I read very little. Maybe 5 physical books at the most. It&#8217;s now December and I&#8217;ve only read 348 books out of the 500 books. I really want to accomplish my goal but that&#8217;s impossible if I want to actually study over the winter holidays because well, my future depends on it. I&#8217;m thinking to change my goal to 400+ books but it feels like I would be cheating the challenge. I am very tempted to do it&#8230;</p>

<p>I took part in many other book challenges this year as well. Such as a colour coded challenge (reading a book with every colour of the rainbow in the title), manga challenge (I exceeded my goal of 100, of course), 1st in a series challenge (I&#8217;ve read 10 out of my goal of 20 since I last updated it), and off the shelf (read 30 books that you have but haven&#8217;t touched, I&#8217;ve only gotten 7 out of 30 although there are some books which I no longer own on that list).</p>

<p>What are the most memorable books of the year so far? Easy peasy!</p>

      <strong>We Were There by Yuki Obata</strong><br /> <em> High school life is one huge rollercoaster for Nanami Takahashi. Boys, drama, and everything else. When she meets Yano Motoharu, he is the one constant in everything that is changing.</em></p>

        This manga series is incomplete but I&#8217;ve ready everything that is currently available to English readers. It is full of angst. To those who don&#8217;t like angst, it may seem like it&#8217;s unnecessarily angsty but I beg to differ. There can never be too much angst! It&#8217;s not so much like your typical love story. The characters are extremely hard headed and you never know what they might do. There&#8217;s always surprises about them that keeps you guessing and wanting to know more. Yeah, I stayed up until 3 in the morning reading this and bawling my eyes out (quietly though as not to wake the parents). </td> </tr> </table>

      &lt;strong&gt;Everything I have read by Ai Yazawa&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I have ranted on too much about Ai Yazawa&amp;#8217;s amazing skills as a mangaka (comic book artist). If you really want to read it, you can see it &lt;a href=&quot;http://room304.brokenphrases.info/updates/2011/06/i-have-an-ai-yazawa-addiction/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.

          &lt;strong&gt;Of Mice and Men by John Steinbeck&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;em&gt;Of Mice and Men takes us into the lives of George and Lennie, two farm workers set out to find their way to a new life. In true Steinbeck form, this short novel explores both loyalty and the transient nature of mankind. (Summary from &lt;a href=&quot;http://goodreads.com&quot;&gt;Goodreads&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 

          &lt;p&gt;
            I read this book for English and I loved it. I read a review for the book once and the reader said, &amp;#8220;This book made me realize that the human mind&amp;#8217;s need for companionship is frighteningly scary&amp;#8221; or something along those lines. I agree wholeheartedly. To those who have not read this book (it&amp;#8217;s short and not that time consuming!), I highly recommend you read it. &lt;/td&gt;
