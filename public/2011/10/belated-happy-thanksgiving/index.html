      <h1 class="title">Belated Happy Thanksgiving!</h1>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>Yesterday was Thanksgiving in Canada land. I wasn&#8217;t able to post because of our super long but extremely satisfying dinner. Turkey, ham, and pasta for all! Not to mention that there was no school yesterday.</p>

<p>I said I was going to create passwords and give them out but that never really happened. It will happen <strike>sometime this week</strike> when I get around to it.</p>

<p>Today was rather interesting. Everyone was talking about post post. In our marching band, there&#8217;s a tradition of having a post party. The party consists of all the band kids from the previous year. It&#8217;s like a reunion. I wasn&#8217;t able to go because I wasn&#8217;t in band last year (I won&#8217;t be able to go next year either because I&#8217;m not in marching band this year).</p>

<p>The actual post party is pretty fun. I went to post last year. You dress up a fancy, have a big dinner with food brought in by everyone, watch last year&#8217;s performance, and give out awards (sexiest music section, mr and mrs tan lines, biggest should be couple, etc), all in the band room.</p>

<p>But post post is what most people look forward to. It&#8217;s post free post. The post party after the post party. That&#8217;s where all the good stuff is (or so I&#8217;ve heard). I&#8217;ve never been to post post. Basically, you get drunk or stay sober and watch drunk people do stupid things, or watch other sober people get stupid things done to them.</p>

<p>Now because I believe in obeying the law (the band members are all grade elevens, twelves, first year university students, or right out of high school workers AKA mostly underaged kids), I never went to post post last year. Plus the appeal of getting drunk for the sake of getting drunk is nonexistent. Okay, some drunk people do funny things, but it&#8217;s not that great when people start throwing up everywhere.</p>

<p>Today everyone was talking about post post and all the hilarious things and I just felt like face palming (although some of the stories were amusing). I was also feeling a bit left out but that&#8217;s really besides the point. I don&#8217;t tolerate stupidity very well from most people. Especially my friends. Ack, what can you do? I&#8217;m like the only senior band geek who has not been drunk in her whole entire life yet. I enjoy being able to truthfully say that.</p>

<p>But more about today. There was no band practice this morning, so I slept in. When I got to school, I walked into the band room to be greeted by the grade ten woodwinds playing Christmas songs. Normally, I wouldn&#8217;t mind listening to Christmas songs even before Halloween is over but the grades tens were just butchering it. My ears are not used to such musical profanity.</p>

<p>In math, we got our quizzes back. I got one question wrong and it&#8217;s because I forgot to convert radians to degrees. I hate making silly mistakes like that because it&#8217;s just like, I could have easily gotten a hundred! My mat teacher also makes you feel stupid when you make mistakes like that, so it didn&#8217;t help me feel any better. But my math teacher was making more jokes than usual today. Maybe he was happy from the Thanksgiving dinner. I quite enjoy my math teacher actually.</p>

<p>Physics was bad. We had to convert graphs into another type of graph. It was so easy but my teacher takes half a class for us to work on things that should only take ten minutes. And then he says &#8220;Oh you have a unit test next week&#8221; when we&#8217;ve barely learned anything. I don&#8217;t know how I&#8217;m going to pass this course.</p>

<p>Lastly, I have my favorite subject! Chemistry. Chemistry was fun but not. We went over our quizzes, which I got 75% on. Blergh. I do not do well with oxidation numbers. However after we did that, we did a lab. A titration lab! I love titration labs. Especially watching the solutions change into one color and then quickly fade away multiple times. It&#8217;s just like, &#8220;Is it going to say pink? Yes? Yes? Oh, just kidding.&#8221; I love chem labs.</p>

<p>Yeah, that was my day. I only had math homework so it was a pretty slack day. I enjoy and fully cherish this semester.</p>
