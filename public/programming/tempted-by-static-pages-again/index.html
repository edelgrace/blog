      <h1 class="title">Tempted by Static Pages Again</h1>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>I recently started learning how to use <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">emacs</a>, which is a text editor and a Lisp interpreter. During my quest for resources, I came across a number of developers and their blogs. Since I&#8217;m always intrigued by what sort of tools developers use to make their blogs, I did a little snooping. A shocking number of people who didn&#8217;t use WordPress as their blogging platform opted for flat files instead.</p>

<p>Now I had dabbled a little bit in static pages before with <a href="https://www.boltwire.com/">BoltWire</a> but ultimately abandoned it to go back to WordPress. I think where I went wrong with BoltWire was that it simply did not have a big enough community (although they are an extremely dedicated community) to keep me reassured that I had made the right choice.</p>

<p>However, I know flat files in general is a real and upcoming thing. Since I&#8217;m planning to use emacs and Markdown files as my main way of documenting things, it would be easy to use it in my blogging as well.</p>

<p>So my main reasons for switching to a flat file system:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Better security</strong><br />
WordPress was giving me so much trouble when it came to security. Yes, Jetpack did help in reducing spam and MySQL doesn&#8217;t randomly stop working anymore but you have to admit that using WordPress on a Digital Ocean server makes you a target.</li></p></li>

<li><p><strong>Version control</strong><br />
Yes, WordPress does have versioning for content however it would be much easier to have version control for settings, themes, etc. over the WordPress kind.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Less bloat</strong><br />
I don&#8217;t need everything that WordPress offers and honestly sometimes I feel like it might be a bit overkill. Since the server I&#8217;m on has limited RAM and disk space, I need to be careful about the amount of resources I use. It helps that I don&#8217;t have many visitors to begin with but still!</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Faster loading times</strong><br />
While I&#8217;m unsure if this is too much of a concern for me but loading times do make me a bit worried. Fetching from a database can be quite slow.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>I want a more future proof blogging system</strong><br />
There are options to export your content into XML files in WordPress however it can&#8217;t beat readable Markdown, which many static file systems use. The fact that everything is file based is future proof in itself. Migrating from one server to the other wouldn&#8217;t be too much hard work.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>My concerns:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>What comment system to use</strong><br />
I do not like Disqus. I dislike the fact that I have to register for yet another site and people can&#8217;t click on my name on a comment and go directly to my website. I also don&#8217;t like the fact that the comments don&#8217;t stay on my server. I want to be able to have my comments.</li>
<li><strong>Learning curve</strong><br />
This would be a little more technically involved at first to get everything installed, just due to the nature of it not being a one-click install.</li>
<li><strong>So many choices!</strong><br />
There is no shortage of flat file systems out there. Like I&#8217;ve said, I&#8217;ve dabbled in BoltWire before and wiki systems but it&#8217;s so hard to find one that will work for you when there&#8217;s a breadth of options.</li>
</ul>

<p>One of the main frameworks I&#8217;ve been looking at is <a href="http://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> which is used by <a href="https://baty.net/">Baty.net</a>, <a href="http://www.modernemacs.com">Modern Emacs</a>, <a href="https://kieranhealy.org">kieranHealy.org</a>, <a href="http://www.rousette.org.uk/blog">but she&#8217;s a girl&#8230;</a>, and more. I am very attracted to this option because it seems like it could work pretty well with an emacs workflow.</p>

<p>Thankfully, I finally recovered my previous website, <a href="http://erzadel.net">erzadel.net</a> and now have access to my old blog posts. I&#8217;ll be tinkering with that this weekend and try to have a clone of my old blog up and running on my local machine. We&#8217;ll see how it goes!</p>
