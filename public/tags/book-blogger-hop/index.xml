 Name a book that changed your life.
 Busting out the big questions. This is a hard one to answer. I think that I&amp;#8217;m still trying to find it. I have my favourite books but I&amp;#8217;m not sure of their impact on my life.</description>

 If you are at a really good point in a book and the phone rings or the door bell rings, do you stop reading or let the phone or door bell go unanswered?
 Honestly, I would get up and check them.</description>

 If you could have lunch with any living authors and/or book bloggers, who would you choose and why?
 Oh man, the living restriction is a tough one. If language wasn&amp;#8217;t a barrier, I would definitely have lunch with Haruki Murakami.</description>

 Do your bookshelves have books ONLY or do you also have bookish items on the shelves?
 I have books, bookish items, and non-bookish items on my shelves. Actually my shelves are in a pretty sorry state. There is a lot of clutter on them and they&amp;#8217;re usually my go to place to put things when I have no idea where to put them.</description>

 When you feature a book in your posts, do you include a book cover?

 If you could meet one author, dead or alive, who would it be? Submitted by Kristin @ Lukten av Trykksverte

 How far in advance do you read the books you have scheduled for review?
 I don&amp;#8217;t read books &amp;#8220;ahead of time.&amp;#8221; I just read books with no schedule in mind and review them as I go. I guess this question is geared towards the more veteran book bloggers who recieve copies of books to read.</description>

 How do you feel about books with multiple narrators? Submitted by Eli @ The Book Supplier
 I definitely don&amp;#8217;t mind them nor do I have a preference towards them. My opinion isn&amp;#8217;t fresh as I haven&amp;#8217;t read a book with multiple narrators in a long time.</description>
