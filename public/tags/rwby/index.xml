      <description>I have been listening to &amp;#8220;Gold&amp;#8221; by Jeff &amp;amp; Casey Lee Williams nonstop all day. I just love it. It makes me want to dance around and sing. It also makes me feel very warm and fuzzy inside. It&amp;#8217;s been a while since I&amp;#8217;ve listened to a song that makes me that gushy. I just can&amp;#8217;t get over the funky discos vibe. Those guitar licks and the strings and Casey&amp;#8217;s voice&amp;#8230; It&amp;#8217;s seriously too much to love!</description>

      <description>Two posts in a row about Rooster Teeth. No regrets. I&amp;#8217;ve been hanging around the Rooster Teeth website1 and just browsing around.
Now, Rooster Teeth has this original animated series called RWBY. Long story short, it&amp;#8217;s about a group of exceptional warrior youths training to fight against creatures and terrorist groups. Cool, I know. One of the major strengths of the series is it&amp;#8217;s soundtrack. The soundtrack is absolutely phenomenal. The producer of the series has stated that music is a big inspiration for his work and it totally shows.</description>
