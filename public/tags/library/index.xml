      <description>I recently made a trip to the library. Here&amp;#8217;s what I managed to grab.
Buried in Books: A Reader&amp;#8217;s Anthology by Julie Rugg
There are quite a lot of books on my to-read list that I don&amp;#8217;t recall exactly why they&amp;#8217;re on the list. But I trust myself if a book is on the list. I actually culled off the more obvious ones but the ones that stayed are ones that really interest me.</description>

      <description>I recently resolved not to take out any library books unless they were on my to read list. Here&amp;#8217;s what I took out on my latest trip to the library!
Speak by Laurie Halse Anderson
I don&amp;#8217;t remember why or how this book got onto my to read list but I know that it&amp;#8217;s been on the list for quite a while. I was glad to see the book sitting on the shelf since I&amp;#8217;ve been looking for it.</description>
