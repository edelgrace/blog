Day 28: Rest Day Oh my goodness, today is the last day of the fitness calendar! I can&amp;#8217;t believe I made it! I didn&amp;#8217;t make this cookie (I haven&amp;#8217;t made any of the rest day recipes) but like with the rest of the recipes, I would love to try this eventually!</description>

Day 27: Total Body Today is the last day of the beginner&amp;#8217;s workout calendar, not including the rest day tomorrow! I think I&amp;#8217;ll make a blog post the day after rest day to talk about how the month went. As for today, today was a lot of sweat and groaning! A lot of cardio today, even if it isn&amp;#8217;t intensive.</description>

Day 26: Abs Video 1: Train Insane HIIT Workout  Video 2: Muffintop Shredder Workout I can&amp;#8217;t remember anymore but I think I&amp;#8217;ve done this video before. This video is really simple, there is just one move: the candlestick. I think I was doing it properly this time because I started to get tired and I could feel burning in my limbs and my core (I can&amp;#8217;t be as technical as Cassey, what are my obliques?</description>

Day 25: Lower Body Video 1: Far Burning Cardio Warmup I&amp;#8217;ve done this video so many times that I&amp;#8217;ve almost memorized everything Cassey said, haha! The moves in this video are easy and fun, as always.
 Video 2: Hips Butt &amp;#8216;n Thighs Super Shaper Workout   Hot Potato: This is a nice and easy move to start off the video.</description>

Day 24: Lower Body I&amp;#8217;m still behind&amp;#8230; Oh well, I mostly caught up today. I still have one video to do for day 25 but it&amp;#8217;s day 25 now and I have three hours left to do it! Today was pretty hard but that could be due to the fact I did two days in one.</description>

Day 23: Abs Okay I&amp;#8217;m pretty behind. It&amp;#8217;s now past midnight, I should be doing day 25 today. I&amp;#8217;m waking up early tomorrow so I&amp;#8217;ll have to skip out on catching up on day 24 until later in the day. Yesterday (two days ago?) I came home late with a huge head ache and immediately fell asleep.</description>

Day 22: Total Body I was so close to not doing today&amp;#8217;s workout because I came home late from a volunteering gig with a raging head ache. I slept for about four hours and woke up around 10:30. It took me a while to get started with the workout, I didn&amp;#8217;t start until 11:15 and I finished at 11:55!</description>

Day 21: Rest Day Today was a much needed rest day. Lately I&amp;#8217;ve been having the tendency to fall asleep as soon as I get home, which sucks. So I decided to just sleep, haha! I didn&amp;#8217;t try out the pizza. Maybe one day. Seriously, one day I will try all of her recipes!</description>

Day 19: Total Body I got home today after writing a midterm and I was so tired that I was tempted to just not do the workout today but then I realized tomorrow os rest day and who wants to work out on rest day? Not me. So I decided against it and got off my butt to do it.</description>

Day 19: Abs I loathe ab days. They&amp;#8217;re really hard and not that fun, haha. But I really do feel the burn the most on these days. I need to work on this&amp;#8230;
Video 1: Fun Indoor Cardio Workout There are A LOT of kicks in this video. I did my workout in the morning today so I had to do some modifications, as always.</description>

Day 18: Lower Body Because I had to make up day 17 today, I broke the two workouts up throughout the day. But near the end of the day, I just did the last two videos all at once. This day&amp;#8217;s workout is surprisingly not that bad. I didn&amp;#8217;t have any trouble with the moves today which was&amp;#8230; Weird but satisfying.</description>

Day 17: Total Body Okay, this is the first time I have skipped a day and had to make it up. I didn&amp;#8217;t feel too guilty about skipping yesterday because I had spin class, which is two (maybe even three) times as long and 234204398 times harder than these workouts. I enjoy spin class though, don&amp;#8217;t get me wrong!</description>

Day 16: Abs Okay, this is the first day that I technically did not do on the right day. I started this one a little after midnight because I was working on an assignment and then I looked at the time&amp;#8230; Whoops, the day went by fast! Today&amp;#8217;s videos were okay.</description>

Day 15: Total Body My body issues seem to have improved, minus the random headaches. I tried my best to stay active and not give into my pain. I might have to go to the doctor tomorrow though, if it gets any worse. Both videos today contained moves that were not named so I&amp;#8217;m not going to bother with going through each move.</description>

Day 14: Rest Day Ummm, what?? It&amp;#8217;s rest day already?? I do not believe it. I&amp;#8217;ve been at this for two weeks now! I feel proud of myself, I never thought I would be able to make it this far. I&amp;#8217;m officially halfway through the calendar! I decided not to do a workout video today because I&amp;#8217;ve been so tired and lethargic lately and all of my limbs feel sore.</description>
