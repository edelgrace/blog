      <description>I missed yesterday as well. I&amp;#8217;m just not very good at this! But I am determined not to miss today. Today I read on Zen Habits that you should never miss doing something two days in a row. It&amp;#8217;s a good philosophy and a great motivation hack for me. By the time two days have passed, it&amp;#8217;s very likely that that task will never be accomplished.
So yes, it&amp;#8217;s around 11:30pm and it takes me around half an hour to write at least 500 words.</description>
