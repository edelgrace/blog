      <description>Man, this was the most productive week I&amp;#8217;ve had since Reading Week! I&amp;#8217;m super happy with my level of productivity. I got a lot done and I still managed to have a large amount of free time all to myself. On Tuesday, I got to hang out with a friend for two hours and I still got stuff done.
On Thursday, I went on a Kill la Kill marathon. My friends have been bugging me about watching it and since the finale was Thursday night, I spent the entire day catching up on the series.</description>
