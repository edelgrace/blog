        <div class="content">
          Tomorrow marks the beginning of Lent. Last year I gave up Tumblr for Lent. This year I&#8217;m giving up using the Internet (minus school things). So for the next 40 days I won&#8217;t be posting, commenting, reading, e-mailing, Twittering, Facebooking or anything that has to do with the Internet. My poor Neopets are going to starve to almost death (that&#8217;s the the first thought that came to my mind, how sad).

          Follow Friday is a weekly book meme hosted by Parajunkee and Alison Can Read. In this meme, us bloggers are asked a question to which we respond to by posting on our blogs. Other bloggers can see our answers, comment, and follow!  This week&#8217;s question is: What’s the most unique character name you’ve come across?  In the spin-off novel of the popular manga and anime series of Death Note, Death Note: Another Note by NISIOSIN, there are a whole load of crazy names.

          Today, my high school hosted a blood donation centre. I wanted to donate blood because, well, it&#8217;s for a good cause, right? I drank tons of water the day of and the day before so in my morning classes I was going to the washroom a whole lot. So, I went to donate blood during lunch time. I filled out a form, got a drop of blood tested for my iron level, answered some questions (sexual history, travelling, and any other things that could influence whether or not my blood is good to donate or not).

          January was a mostly boring month. Filled with studying, tears, gaming, eating, sleeping, more tears, and a bit more studying. The only exciting day was yesterday, which was the first day of the semester. The last semester of high school. Oh, the end is near.
One of my the girls in my section told me that there was band practice the morning of the first day of semester. I went to school at seven and&#8230; No band practice.

          Technically this is the second trip to the library this year but this is the first post about it.
Right after I finished my chemistry diploma exam on Thursday, my dad drove me to the library. I felt at home, how sad, haha. Usually I go upstairs to the teen section, but oh ho, not this time! I went straight to the adult comics section. I&#8217;m quite the rebel, I know.

          Finally, my final exams are over! I only wrote math and chemistry but I studied my butt off for both of them. Yesterday I had chemistry. It was mad hard but I have to admit that I studied math more than I did for chemistry. I did go to a diploma prep for chemistry which somewhat helped. Math was super easy but I&#8217;m still worried over it. Super easy could mean that it was really super easy or that I just thought it was easy when in reality, I did everything wrong.

I&#8217;m actually being productive. Okay, yesterday and the day before I didn&#8217;t study at all and now I&#8217;m freaking out because I have a test on Monday. What do I do about it? I post on my blog. Oh the life of a procrastinator.

          Yesterday was my birthday. Yay birthdays! I&#8217;m now the golden age of 17 (this means I have to change all my ages on my websites, ack)! I kinda don&#8217;t feel any different (no one ever does, am I right?), not to mention that 17 is a weird number. I guess it&#8217;s because it&#8217;s odd. But 21 and 23 aren&#8217;t that weird of numbers either. I guess 17 is weird because it&#8217;s that age that&#8217;s in between.

          Yesterday was my last day of school. It was pretty pointless as it was a half day and each class was half an hour long. We also had band practice in the morning! Thankfully it was cut short because the band teachers had to go carol with the other teachers at the front of the school. They actually sounded pretty good. I was expecting horrible off key belting and such but no.

          Whoot~ I got 94% on my chem test! However, I wrote a physics test today and I just know that didn&#8217;t go very well. I have a math test tomorrow so as soon as I finish writing this post, I&#8217;m going to go study.
Last year around this time, I set a goal for myself: read 100 books before 2011 ends. I&#8217;m an avid manga reader and I can finish one volume of manga in an hour so a week into the challenge I found that I was already a quarter of the way through the challenge (keep in mind this was during winter break, haha).

          This morning was a great morning! Most band practices aren&#8217;t that exciting but this one was pretty good. We played the opener and the second song of the show. In marching band, the members run around a football field making pretty shapes while playing their instruments. Those 11 minutes of organized chaos is what we call a show. At my highschool we have a marching band. I&#8217;m in band but I don&#8217;t march because of money and time issues.
