        <div class="content">
          My New Year&#8217;s resolutions aren&#8217;t going so well. I&#8217;m pretty sure I&#8217;ve broken at least half of them already! But that doesn&#8217;t mean I&#8217;m giving up on them. I&#8217;m starting fresh this week, and I will get stuff done.
This week is going to be tough. I have two midterms on subjects that I have absolutely no idea on what&#8217;s going on. I didn&#8217;t study as much as I wanted to on the weekend.

        <div class="content">
          I just woke up from a dream and I have to write about it. I&#8217;m not sure if it&#8217;s some kind of omen or just a representation of the current state of my mind, but either way, it spooked me pretty badly.
So I was at the train station, going up the stairs to reach the far end of the platform. The stations have walls that are on the sides of the tracks and they join together above the platform to make a ceiling.

        <div class="content">
          When I let my friends know that I want to be a librarian after I exhaust my career as a software engineer, one of them laughed at me and said, &#8220;A librarian with an engineering degree? Are you doing to make houses out of books?&#8221; I just smiled and responded with a witty comment but inside I wondered, &#8220;What&#8217;s wrong with that?&#8221;
While surfing the web, I stumbled upon Graeme Ing, a YA author and a former game developer.

        <div class="content">
          I love WordPress. It&#8217;s the best content management system for me and extremely flexible. Anything is possible in WordPress. However, lately I&#8217;ve been noticing a lack in the number of blogs from undergrads and grads alike. I searched high and low on WordpPess, Blogger, etc. Then I remembered: Tumblr. Not surprisingly, the student blogging community is thriving on Tumblr. 
Tumblr is less of a blogging platform, but more of a social media website.

          I have a hard time reading textbooks. I can&#8217;t read blocks of text. Yes, regular old books are blocks of text but textbooks aren&#8217;t meant to be read the same way regular books are; they&#8217;re meant to be skimmed. Even so, I still have trouble. Maybe it&#8217;s only the university level textbooks that are causing me trouble. but that doesn&#8217;t mean they should be any less readable.

          &#8230; Is getting an adult library card. I&#8217;m not even joking. I detested the teen library card. It was too &#8220;hip&#8221; for me. So I rather like my simplistic and pretty white adult library card. The bad thing is that I have to memorize a new card number. Although the number for my new card has bits and pieces of my address and home phone number so I reckon it&#8217;s not that bad.

        <div class="content">
          As a Catholic, I&#8217;m always working towards understanding my faith, living my faith, properly representing my faith, and lately: being in harmony with those who do not share my faith. A couple of years ago, I was an ignorant little brat, believing myself better than others who didn&#8217;t actually identify as Catholic despite going to a Catholic school. That mentality quickly faded away once high school began but that didn&#8217;t mean that I became &#8220;any less Catholic.&#8221;
I tried my best to keep a delicate balance between my more secular values and my, well, not so secular values. It&#8217;s hard. I still try to do this today. More often than not, my secular values seem to dominate over everything else but I still have this longing to grow in my faith and fully live it out.
Earlier on this semester, the campus bookstore was having a hallway sale. It was my break time, I had nothing better to do and the prices seemed cheap enough, so I went ahead and browsed for around half an hour. There were a couple of books that intrigued me but there was one book that kept me coming back to it. &#8220;Through the Narrow Gate: Life In and Out of the Convent&#8221; by Karen Armstrong.

1. Post more I hate how this has to be a resolution, but yes, I want to post more.

          They say that one of the easiest ways to lose weight is to keep track of what you&#8217;re eating. I&#8217;ve decided to apply this to my own life in order to lose some weight. I&#8217;m not talking about the physical kind of weight but the dead weight that everyone carries around and hinders them in some way. This blog, The Librarian Code, will help me to lose some of that dead weight.
