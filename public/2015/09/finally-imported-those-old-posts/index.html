      <div class="content">
        <p>So now that I&#8217;ve moved hosts, I decided to do some spring cleaning (fall cleaning?). Right now, my databases are a mess. I have a lot of databases that aren&#8217;t used and databases that are waiting to be used. I still had my old blog database, back from when Brokenphrases was my main blog. So, I decided to to import all those pages and posts here.</p>

<p>Now my blog post archive is pretty much complete. It was such a nostalgia trip going back and reading my old posts. A lot of them were cringe worthy, too. Mostly I just spent a lot of time clicking on links to old websites that I&#8217;ve mentioned in my posts. It&#8217;s so weird to think that I&#8217;ve been blogging (on and off) for over seven years now. I really wish I could be more consistent with my posts so that I have a more clearer picture of what my life was like when I look back on them again, but life doesn&#8217;t always work out the way you want it too&#8230;</p>

<p>Right now I&#8217;m procrastinating (as always, not much has changed in seven years). I&#8217;m kind of sick but not sick enough to warrant me staying in bed and doing nothing. Yesterday was my dad&#8217;s birthday party and I spent the evening entertaining my little cousin. He is absolutely adorable! He&#8217;s a little on the chubby side but I love chubby kids. He reminds me of a marshmallow! We played Checkers and Scrabble the whole night. Well&#8230; Our version of Checkers and Scrabble! We decided to bend the rules because my little cousin wasn&#8217;t convinced! Regardless, it was a nice night.</p>

<p>I also spent a good chunk of yesterday creating a LinkedIn profile and fixing my resume. I&#8217;m a little hesitant about my resume because I don&#8217;t have that much work experience but my friend promised to help me with it. There&#8217;s a volunteer position open at the organization she also volunteers for and it would be nice to get more things on my resume. Plus, they need a lot of help this year. I&#8217;ve witnessed it first hand, my friend seems to be doing everything by herself almost! Sometimes I try to help where I can but more of the bigger things require me to in an actual volunteer position. Hopefully I can land it!</p>

<p>Alright, that was just a quick update. I really do need to get to work on my school things. I have a couple of lecture notes that I need to catch up on and a few readings to do. Hopefully I can bring some more non-Tumblr posts here!</p>
