      <h1 class="title">25 Before 25: Update #1</h1>
      
      <div class="content">
        <p>I took a little break during the month of May. My mental health was honestly at an all time low and I found myself having a hard time picking myself back up to get motivated to actually do things. Since I am around 6 months into my 22nd year of living, I thought it would be a good time to pause and reflect how I&#8217;m doing with my 25 before 25. I only two and a half years left after all.</p>

<p><strong>1. Graduate from university</strong>: Good progress</p>

<p>I am on track with this, thankfully! So far I am passing all of my courses and seem to look good to graduate at the end of the year. I still need to register for one more course in September but I&#8217;m having trouble finding a course that I am interested in that won&#8217;t conflict with other courses.</p>

<p><strong>2. Move out of my parents‚Äô house</strong>: No progress</p>

<p>My moving out fund is slowly getting chipped away due to paying for tuition. I still need a job secured for this summer. I really want to get one ASAP so I can get that cash flow going.</p>

<p><strong>3. Max out my TFSA</strong>: Some progress</p>

<p>When I was on internship, I put most of my paycheque into my TFSA. I still have a ways to go before maxing out my TFSA but I definitely have the funds in there. They will not be touched for a while.</p>

<p><strong>4. Open a RRSP account</strong>: No progress</p>

<p>This won&#8217;t happen until I get a semi-permanent job and I don&#8217;t see that happening until I graduate. Fingers crossed.</p>

<p><strong>5. Get a full time job in my field</strong>: No progress</p>

<p>This also won&#8217;t happen until I graduate.</p>

<p><strong>6. Read 150 books/50 books per year</strong>: Good progress</p>

<p>This year I have read around 36 books. There are still half a year left so I&#8217;d say I&#8217;m ahead of the game for this year.</p>

<p><strong>7. Finish the Dragon Age series</strong>: Little progress</p>

<p>I started playing The Witcher 3 and unfortunately, most of my gaming time has been spent on that. This has been a good reminder for me to boot up Origins sometime soon.</p>

<p><strong>8. Make my own TCG</strong>: No progress</p>

<p>I haven&#8217;t had a lot of time to code lately but I need to get started planning this seriously. Maybe I will dedicate this weekend to do so.</p>

<p><strong>9. Finish my Pomodoro app project</strong>: No progress</p>

<p>As said before, haven&#8217;t done a lot of coding this year. I also need to draw a good plan for this.</p>

<p><strong>10. Make a book review website</strong>: No progress</p>

<p>Woah, look at all these projects I haven&#8217;t started on yet. I need to figure out which project to prioritize first. This website has been a long time coming but the TCG will be the most work. We&#8217;ll see.</p>

<p><strong>11. Get my driver‚Äôs license</strong>: No progress</p>

<p>Have yet to sit in the driver&#8217;s seat yet this year. I have to check my learner&#8217;s permit and see when it expires. I need a teacher and my poor father is reluctant to teach me because I am unsafe.</p>

<p><strong>12. Make friends outside of the tech bubble</strong>: Negligible progress</p>

<p>My mental health stumbling block last month has done a lot for me to trip up on this. I am struggling with making friends in general right now and I&#8217;m finding it extremely hard. I started going to crochet meetups and will hopefully go regularly enough to make a friend or two.</p>

<p><strong>13. Get fit</strong>: Some progress</p>

<p>In May I felt like I regressed a lot but I am starting to go back to the gym. Yesterday I went to the gym on campus and my nerves only got me to do some cardio on the machines but I did something which was relieving.</p>

<p><strong>14. Floss more regularly</strong>: No progress</p>

<p>Nope. Hasn&#8217;t happened yet. Starting today.</p>

<p><strong>15. Drink. More. Water.</strong>: Some progress</p>

<p>When I was sitting around at work, I was drinking a lot of water. Now back at school, I&#8217;m finding it hard to remember to drink water. In fact, I&#8217;m thirsty right now. I will go and get some water right now. Water break!</p>

<p><strong>16. Learn how to actually cook</strong>: Little progress</p>

<p>My mom left the country to go the Philippines in May. I got some opportunities to cook. Just really small things. Made pizza, chicken wings, breakfast. Nothing hardcore.</p>

<p><strong>17. Travel internationally without family</strong>: No progress</p>

<p>I need that cash first and foremost.</p>

<p><strong>18. Konmari ALL of my things</strong>: No progress</p>

<p>This summer vacation, for sure.</p>

<p><strong>19. Get drunk for the first time</strong>: Almost there</p>

<p>I got tipsy once so far. It was weird. Almost there. One day.</p>

<p><strong>20. Get my CCNA certification</strong>: No progress</p>

<p>I kinda gave up my CCNA courses so I just might start to study on my own.</p>

<p><strong>21. Attend Zoo Lights</strong>: No progress</p>

<p>It&#8217;s the start of summer so I will have to wait until winter comes back around to go to Zoo Lights.</p>

<p><strong>22. Get a grasp on my depression</strong>: Some progress</p>

<p>I am currently doing some counseling to combat this. Also taking part of an online cognitive behavioural therapy course. Exercise will hopefully help as well.</p>

<p><strong>23. Continue my pen pal relationships</strong>: No progress</p>

<p>I&#8217;m such a bad pen pal. üôÅ Gah! I don&#8217;t have a P.O. box anymore and I&#8217;m not entirely comfortable not using one. We&#8217;ll see.</p>

<p><strong>24. Go to a concert</strong>: No progress</p>

<p>Haven&#8217;t seen any concerts that caught my eye yet. Wait, let me check right now. Nope, nothing catches my eye at the moment.</p>

<p><strong>25. Make a dent in my to-watch movie list</strong>: Some progress</p>

<p>I watched Ella Enchanted. That&#8217;s one out of many, right?</p>
