      <div class="content">
        <p>Two blog posts in a week?? Is this even possible? I&#8217;m probably dreaming but it&#8217;s happening. For real.</p>

<p>Whenever I first get on the computer, I find myself starting out pretty darn focused. I open up Blackboard, see what&#8217;s new, check my falling grades, cry, start on my assignments, etc. Then suddenly it&#8217;s 1 in the morning (I&#8217;m exaggerating, the latest I&#8217;ve started homework was like 10pm&#8230; Still pretty bad though). So yeah, it&#8217;s &#8220;1 in the morning.&#8221; I have a couple assignments due in a couple of hours and all I&#8217;ve done was look at fanart of grey kids with horns. My first thought whenever this happens is, &#8220;Where did all of my time go??&#8221;</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve tried tracking the usage of my time before. I used a program called RescueTime but it was too broad. It told me what programs I was using and a few select sites that I frequented but it wasn&#8217;t enough! Then I downloaded <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/timestats/ejifodhjoeeenihgfpjijjmpomaphmah">timeStats</a>{.external} last week for Chrome.</p>

<p>Okay, this is a beautiful plugin. It&#8217;s really easy to use too! Install it and wait and see how much time you waste on YouTube.</p>

<p>But what I really love about this little thing is the categories option. Every single website you visit is stored and you categorize them into your own categories. I made three of them.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Productive:</strong> The websites I want to be on. Such as my assignment websites and general uni stuff. Wolfram alpha may or may not be in this category&#8230;</li>
<li><strong>Potential time wasters:</strong> You know those sites that you go on with a purpose but then one hour later, you&#8217;re still on said site without having fulfilled said purpose? Yeah, those sites.</li>
<li><strong>Time wasters:</strong> YouTube. Tumblr. Twitter. Facebook. Blogs. My blogs. My websites. Anything that can distract me for HOURS from my school work. Sadly, there are a lot of them&#8230;</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="http://brokenphrases.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Categories.png"><img src="http://brokenphrases.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Categories-300x160.png" alt="Category breakdown" title="Categories" width="300" height="160" class="left" /></a></p>

<p>This plugin is really handy in that it displays the data clearly in pie charts and graphs. I&#8217;m a sucker for pie charts and graphs. So let&#8217;s look at my Internet usage in terms of these categories for the past week. Now these percentages probably don&#8217;t mean anything to you so I&#8217;ll quantify them even further. In other words, I&#8217;ve spent 22:54 hours on time wasting sites, 11:17 hours on productive sites, and 6:30 hours on potential time wasting sites. I&#8217;ve spent almost a day a week wasting my time. A day. For every productive hour, I spend two hours doing nothing. That&#8217;s&#8230; Really discouraging. I mean I know I procrastinate a lot but I didn&#8217;t know I procrastinated this much. The next burning question in my mind was, what sites do I spend most of my time on? And yes, timeStats gives you the answer to this too!</p>

<p><a href="http://brokenphrases.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Sites.png"><img src="http://brokenphrases.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Sites-300x156.png" alt="" title="Sites" width="300" height="156" class="right" /></a></p>

<p>Okay, well I already know the site I visit the most. <a href="http://tumblr.com">Tumblr</a>{.external}. I spend an ungodly amount of my time on the damned website. A total of 11:50 hours this week. Microblogging is just so fast and easy. And most of all: addictive. All I&#8217;m doing is looking at pictures people have shared with me and clicking a button to share it with other people. Probably the lowest form of &#8220;blogging&#8221; there ever is. But I do it anyway.</p>

<p>The second most visited site is a good one though, with a total of 4:42 hours. MathXL is my homework site for calculus. It&#8217;s kinda sad that I&#8217;ve spent 5 hours doing one assignment though. It was a fairly easy assignment too. I&#8217;ve lost all faith in my calculus abilities&#8230; Not that I had much faith in them to begin with.</p>

<p>Google Docs is seriously SO HANDY for group projects that involve presentations and final reports. It&#8217;s so much easier that way! <a href="http://mspaintadventures.com">MS Paint Adventures</a>{.external} is the website that hosts the web comic, Homestuck. Don&#8217;t go there. There are over 7000 pages over silly shenanigans that are way too easily to get lost in. <a href="http://www.zachleat.com">Zachleat</a>{.external} has a useful alarm app that can play a YouTube video at full blast when it goes off. I use it a lot, apparently. More than I thought I ever did anyway. I also post a lot on the forums over at <a href="ubi.com">Ubi</a>{.external}. About the Assassin&#8217;s Creed series. It&#8217;s a good game, okay?? And the rest of the sites are pretty straightforward. Like Facebook, for example. It&#8217;s evil.</p>

<p>So yes, my findings with this little plugin is this: I spend too much time doing irrelevant shi&#8230;take mushrooms on the Internet. But I&#8217;m working on it! First off by limiting my Tumblr use. Although most of my attempts are like this:</p>

<p>Me: Go away Tumblr, I don&#8217;t need you anymore. All you do is CAUSE ME PAIN.</p>

<p>Tumblr: Ok bye.</p>

<p>Me: Just kidding. I can&#8217;t live without you. Never leave me. WHERE ARE YOU GOING?? COME BACK HERE!</p>

<p>Yeah okay I have finals to study for. Bye for now!</p>
